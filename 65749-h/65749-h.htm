<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>AN ENGLISHWOMAN IN ANGORA</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>At</span> the time of writing I am the only Englishwoman who
has been in Angora since the Nationalist movement
began.</p>
<p class='c012'>Others, moved by curiosity, have sought permission
to visit the country under its new <i>régime</i>, but
Nationalist Turkey has bidden them wait—until she
is sure that her guests will write, or speak, the <i>truth</i>
about what they may see, and can be trusted to
forget the prejudices with which they would almost
certainly arrive.</p>

<p class='c012'>For myself, I have three times been welcomed to
Turkey with open arms <i>on account</i> of my nationality.
On this occasion I was still welcome, but <i>in spite of</i>
my nationality—an ugly truth that my mind almost
refuses to accept.</p>

<p class='c012'>To compare impressions from these visits one must
first ask: “How could such a change of attitude come
to pass?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Formerly Great Britain was <i>the</i> country of all
countries that “counted” in Turkey. To be a
“gentleman”—(they used the English word)—was
the Turks’ highest ambition. British stuffs were
chosen in preference to French, <i>not</i> because they were
finer or of greater value, but simply because they were
<i>British</i>. Our ideals, our policy, and, I must add,
our governesses, were almost regarded as sacred in
Turkish eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>And now I am advised, for greater safety, to travel
as an American! God forbid! I stand by the old
flag.</p>

<p class='c012'>I would smile, could the tears be hidden, when I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>recall the police officer who so solemnly enquired if
<i>I was sure</i> I was not an American.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perfectly sure,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How then,” said he, “has that impossibility—an
Englishwoman in Angora—become possible?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your Government,” I answered, “has made it
possible. As you have no one else here from my
country, I have given myself this mission.... An
old friend of the Turks, a woman who loves her own
country! Can she not do <i>something</i> for that peace
between us, which is a supreme necessity to both?
That is why I am here.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I do not forget that Turks were our “enemies”
in the war. But they came back, beaten to the dust—and
penitent. Then was the moment for us to have
made our own terms. In that mood Turkey would
have accepted—anything, but the <i>one thing</i> we imposed
on her—the Greeks at Smyrna! That policy
of sheer folly has transformed the veneration of her
people into fear and distrust, if not hate.</p>

<p class='c012'>Unjustly and unreasonably as we have behaved
towards our old ally, we were not, indeed, alone in
this mischievous exalting of Greek aggressions. Dare
we not now own our mistake? We are great enough,
and strong enough, to be generous, to mend our ways!</p>

<p class='c012'>To-day, surely, it is the duty of English patriots
to pour oil on the troubled waters, to explain to Turkey
what <i>can</i> be explained, and to paint our countrymen,
at least, less “black” than they have been made to
seem by our rivals’ pen!</p>

    <div>ON BOARD THE “PIERRE LOTI”—TURKEY’S DEBT TO LOTI’S MAGIC PEN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Over</span> a sea as smooth as ice, the sun shining brightly
most of the way, the Messageries Maritimes steamer
<i>Pierre Loti</i> is carrying us to Smyrna. Ten years ago,
to a beaten Turkey (unable, it was supposed, to face
an enemy for years to come), I had taken the same trip.
And now, despite the prophets, I am returning to a
victorious people; doubly victorious, since all the
odds were against them.</p>
<p class='c012'>“That is the kind of story I love,” I remarked to
the sympathetic captain and his daughter, with whom I
generally lunched as guest in their own cabin. They,
indeed, were particularly interested in my adventure,
for they knew the Near East well, and this was to be
their last visit. Because he had just reached the age
limit of those who ‘go down to the sea in ships,’ though
it was only when you caught the word ‘papa’ upon
his daughter’s lips that anyone would suspect the fact.</p>

<p class='c012'>So they are blessed who marry young!</p>

<p class='c012'>“It seems strange,” I told him one morning, “to
be here—on board the <i>Pierre Loti</i>, and surely a presage
of good luck, since his books have done so much to
increase and widen my inborn sympathies with the
East.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Still more strange it proved; since the captain
himself had named the ship for his admiration of the
great French writer and in memory of personal friendship
between them. A rare literary association for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>a steamer once in the service of the Czars. Wherefore,
also, I found the master’s works in the ship’s
library, and could renew acquaintance with many an
old favourite: “Ramuntcho,” “Matelot,” “Ispahan,”
“Les Pêcheurs d’Islande” and the “Désenchantées.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The captain told me of his visit to Rochefort, and
<i>I</i> told <i>him</i> how Antoine went to the same house for
final instructions upon the staging of “Ramuntcho,”
which, however, did not prove a success. How, indeed,
could anyone think of dramatising Pierre Loti, whether
in prose or verse? He gives us neither psychology
nor dramatic incident. I can only suppose that
Antoine permitted them to be produced—to show once
for all that the thing could not be done; a hard lesson
for the master!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Among Loti’s collection of priceless treasures,
rifled from every corner of the East, Antoine sought in
vain for somewhere to place his hat! Finally, he
hooked it on to an Eastern idol, and their talk began.
In a few moments, however, there was a pause, for
the astonished dramatist caught sight of the offending
headgear suspended, as he supposed, in mid-air.
However, a closer look revealed that it was resting
upon a thin stream of water. The Eastern idol was a
fountain!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The captain expressed his surprise that I should not
only be so familiar with Loti’s work, but that I could
really know anything intimately of his private life,
“seeing how the Frenchman disliked my own country.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear sir,” I replied, “if we are to find our
friends to-day only among those who love England,
we should be limited indeed. You and your charming
daughter, <i>par exemple</i>, are you precisely admirers of
the British Government?...</p>

<p class='c012'>“To me, Art is first, and the rest—nowhere! I
care not whether the genius first saw daylight in Paris,
in New York, or in Timbuctoo. I have more friends
out of England than in England. Like Kipling’s
cat, ‘all places are alike to me.’ I only ask that your
land be warm; and with all peoples who do not rob
me I am ready and eager to be good friends. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>‘guard the frontiers’ in Art would be to bring back
the Dark Ages. The most sincere love of one’s own
country should never teach one to be disdainful of <i>les
autres</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are going to Nationalist Turkey,” he replied,
“you will find yourself right up against Chauvinism
all the time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t believe it. Forgive me, I really think
you exaggerate. And besides—with my strong sympathies
for the Turks!—I have always found Orientals
the most broad-minded men.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then I brought back the talk to Pierre Loti. “Why
do you say that he dislikes England so much?” I
asked. “He <i>does</i> object to golf near the Pyramids;
he <i>is</i> a little sarcastic about ‘Messrs. Thos. Cook &amp;
Co., Egypt, Ltd.,’ forgetting what it means to travel
without them; he dislikes our Government for its
pro-Greek policy and its injustice towards the Turks.
As an Englishwoman I agree. And, like him, too, I
regard New York as the nearest earthly approach to
hell! We certainly do not hate America; only its
noise, its materialism, and its advertising.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I knew Pierre Loti best, perhaps, at his charming
Basque home in Hendaye—thanks to my friendship
with his heroines, Melek and Zeyneb. I know, at
one time, he resented what seemed to him our Edward
VII.’s ‘interference’ in French affairs. But that
master of diplomats never gave his advice unasked;
and, when he was told of the great Frenchman’s
hostility, Pierre Loti was promptly invited to Windsor,
and they became the best of friends. Would he were
with us now, that he might but talk with the Ministers
of both nations!</p>

<p class='c012'>“After Windsor, Loti, I’m sure, would have
spared his sarcasm. ‘There is one thing left now,’ he
once declared. ‘We must appeal to H.M. Edward VII.
<i>He</i> only can do what he likes in France!’ The French
Admiralty had just refused him permission to carry
away from one of their ships the table on which he
had written the ‘Désenchantées.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>The captain, it seemed, was ready to waive this point.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“But I do not consider,” he resumed, “that
Loti’s books are a true picture of Turkey as she is.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They would not, indeed, suit his arch-enemy
Messrs. Cook,” I replied; “as Turner painted, he
wrote, for those who have eyes to see. Tell him you
never saw <i>his</i> Turkey, and he would reply: ‘Don’t
you wish you could?’...</p>

<p class='c012'>“Had Loti himself been English, he would, naturally,
have reached a larger public among us. The warmth
of his colouring is too often lost in translation. As a
schoolgirl I learnt by heart the wonderful Preface to
his “Ispahan”: ‘<i>Qui vent venir avec moi voir les roses
d’Ispahan</i>,’ and I have dreamt of those roses ever
since.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The captain then spoke of the avenue at Constantinople
which bears his name.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A charming remembrance,” I replied, “but he
needs no such ‘rosemary.’ Do we realise, I wonder,
what French influence in the Near East owes to his
supreme art. In England, except for a small minority,
the word Turkey only means a vision of fair houris,
veiled in the mysteries of the past, the great ‘Red’
Sultan, and massacres in Armenia. To France it
means Aziadé, the Green Mosque at Brousse, Djénane,
and the Fantômes d’Orient. Public opinion, to-day,
can be ‘manufactured’ as easily as butter and cheese;
but the imaginations once stirred by the magician’s
pen will not yield so easily to the last Brew of Hate.
France is not going to lose her dream of the East woven
from Loti’s pen. A debt of gratitude neither she, nor
Turkey itself, can ever pay.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To travel by this steamer, bearing the name of a
writer one loves so well, brings unceasing delight.
Your menu-card, the life-belts on deck, even the
towels, all bear a name to fill the mind with memory of
beautiful things. As my eyes fell on the <i>Pierre Loti’s</i>
lifeboat, swinging on its davits, I recalled the “Pêcheurs
d’Islande,” with its tragic close: “and he never
returned!” All the sorrow, the suffering, and the
heart-ache; the useless watching, waiting, and longing—this,
for the women, is War!</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Are we, indeed, to begin <i>that</i> all over again? For a
“Greater Greece” than the Greeks themselves can
sustain?</p>

<p class='c012'>If <i>all</i> women who have suffered (and who has not?)
would march to Westminster to protest, would any
hear and pause? Can we fight a Press in the service
of profiteers, bolstering up the Government, blocking
the public view?</p>

<p class='c012'>Are we not, after all, mere “pawns” of a Destiny
that none can avert?</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Pierre Loti’s long and interesting life is now very
quickly drawing to its close. He has written his last
words—a defence of his beloved Turks.</p>

    <div>TURKEY AND TOLERANCE—A FRIENDSHIP WASTED</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>My</span> supreme interest in Turkey among the Moslem
nations, arose from influences, or instincts, I cannot now
with any certainty determine. I suspect, however, it
was in part reaction against the injustice of Gladstone—the
idol of my father’s youth, until the betrayal of his
hero Gordon—and in part indignation with those who
called the Koran an “accursed book.” <i>My</i> religion
is the universal tolerance I expect for my own, and I
can feel only the most profound admiration for the
Great Prophet of Islam, whose fine personality has
left so benign an influence throughout the East, and for
his “Bible,” with its noble study of our own Christ.
Carlyle, you will remember, pays glowing tribute to
this “Prophet Hero!”</p>
<p class='c012'>So I devoured every book that I could lay hands on
about these interesting peoples; fought for introductions
to anyone who could talk of them, from book-knowledge
or personal acquaintance; studied medicine—that
their women might suffer less.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was in 1906 that I first met Pierre Loti’s “disenchanted”
heroines, Zeyneb and Melek; and we soon
became the closest friends. The tale of their daring,
but unpractical, flight had stirred my imagination.
Their father was one of Abdul Hamid’s Ministers,
and two or three times during my visit they were almost
kidnapped by order of the Sultan. On one occasion
it was, indeed, only a miracle which disclosed the plot
that was to have carried them off (by motor from Nice
to Marseilles, thence back by boat to Constantinople)
to the punishment awaiting them.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>For hours they held me spellbound by their vivid
descriptions of harem life, particularly the Sultan’s,
and of the “Terror” under Abdul Hamid. With this
clever monster at the helm, the Turks suffered a hundred
times more than the Christians. Whole regiments of
Albanians ceased to exist; whole companies went off
to Yemen and were forgotten; Ministers died suddenly,
and private families disappeared wholesale. Yet they
must be thrown out of Europe, “bag and baggage,”
because, in a minor degree, Christian Armenians, too,
bled under Abdul Hamid!</p>

<p class='c012'>After the departure of the two Hanoums (Turkish
ladies), their father died suddenly. And though, when
in Constantinople, I did my best to see and console
their widowed mother, she persisted in regarding me
as one of those <i>giaours</i> who had stolen away her
daughters! And would listen to no defence or explanation.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was then that I heard much of the coming
Revolution: when and where “meetings” had taken
place, who were members of the “secret societies,”
which of their friends in prison would be liberated.
In 1908, the Day of Deliverance suddenly came,
to the astonishment of the whole world, and I, too,
rejoiced, as though my own country were now set
free!</p>

<p class='c012'>I was, luckily, again in Constantinople for those
great days. I saw the hideous tyrant of a few years
ago driven through the streets of Pera; I was present
at the opening of Parliament; introduced to the Sultan
Abdul Hamid and his Grand Vizier Kiamil Pasha.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was the Vizier’s charming daughter who soon
became my dearest friend, and hostess for two subsequent
visits. Once she spoke of me to Abdul Hamid’s
successor, Mohammed V., as her “English sister”
(her favourite term of endearment), and the Sultan
replied: “I did not know Kiamil Pasha had any
English children.” Poor man, he had a Turkish family
of a score!</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Hamid’s fall that first revealed to me how
much Turkey loved England, what she was ready to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>give for British friendship. I had witnessed the
arrival of our Ambassador, the late Sir G. Lowther,
and his triumphant entry to Constantinople, when the
horses were taken out of his carriage and he was drawn
by Turks to the Embassy. As Abdul Hamid had compromised
the nation by friendship with Germans, young
Turkey threw herself at the feet of Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c012'>Why could we not respond? Alas, our Ambassador
and his French colleague, M. Constant, would openly
express their preference for the despotic Abdul Hamid.
And what was said, no doubt with no serious thought
of offence, reached the ears of the young Turks and
stung their pride: “People who visit Constantinople
may be divided into two classes: those who like dirt
and squalor” (of whom I was one), “and those who
do not!”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was inevitable that the Germans should make
<i>their</i> profit from <i>our</i> discourtesy and blind contempt.
We ought, from the first, to have known that she would
send, as indeed she did, one of her finest diplomats to
Constantinople. Marshall von Bieberstein, and his
“retriever,” Dr. W—— of the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i>
lost no opportunity of conciliating the young
Turks, to what end we might, surely, have foreseen!</p>

<p class='c012'>After the Balkan war, I paid a visit to vanquished
Turkey; this time as a guest of my “Turkish sister” in
Stamboul, whose father had been, meanwhile, banished
to Cyprus, where he died. Under the circumstances I
could not (for fear of further compromising my friends
with the Government) see much of our Ambassador,
Sir Louis Mallet, though I met him twice, and found
him a charming man.</p>

<p class='c012'>To all my appeals, at the Embassy and elsewhere,
for British friendship and help to put Turkey on her
feet again, I met the same foolish, “parrot” reply:
“We cannot sacrifice Russia!” Nevertheless, when I
returned to London, and published “An Englishwoman
in a Turkish Harem” (the diary record of private friendships,
widely circulated in the East), we, the friends
of Turkey, determined to defy the Government, and
formed an Ottoman Society for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>When the war broke out I had just reached Berlin,
once more <i>en route</i> for Turkey, Asia Minor, and afterwards
Persia and India.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is obvious that the world-tragedy had even a
sharper sting for those of us who were bidden to hate
our life-long “best friends” among the enemy peoples.
Often enough, moreover, the individual “foe” (as
was the case with my Turkish “sister”) could not
throw off the heart’s allegiance to England merely
because “it was war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Can we, indeed, honestly blame the young Turks?
In the first place, they did not choose their own path.
One man, Enver Pasha, joined Germany <i>against</i> the
wishes of a whole nation. As <i>one</i> man, Mr. Lloyd George,
would once have drawn the most constitutional of
all peoples to fight the Turks, had not General Harington,
luckily for them and us, disobeyed his command!</p>

<p class='c012'>Besides, we did <i>nothing</i> to preserve our friendship
with Turkey. Years of indifference, and most impolitic
scoffings at real reforming enthusiasm, were
followed, at the eleventh hour, by total neglect of any
conciliating diplomacy, which could even then have
kept Turkey out of the war, and shortened it by two
years.</p>

<p class='c012'>For instance, on the outbreak of war with Germany,
“without notice, without the most banal of the forms
of courtesy, on the very day when the Turkish flag
should have been hoisted over the ships handed over
to the Ottoman Commission, which had come to England
to take charge of them, the dreadnoughts were
seized by Great Britain and no offer was made by the
British Government to refund, at least, the price of the
two ships....” So wrote the late Grand Vizier Hakki
Pasha; and one could mention many other, similar,
senseless pin-pricks, which may inflame such people
almost more than insults of greater import.</p>

<p class='c012'>During the war my friendship for Turkey proved a
serious handicap in hospital work. Anyone jealous
of what privileges were by chance accorded to me would
hand over a few choice tit-bits—that grew in passing—to
the secret police. The French, unless in a fit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>really inevitable war-depression, paid scant heed to
such reports. The Americans, however, easily took
alarm. One, I remember, actually spoke to me about
the matter with a terror only equalled, in my experience,
by that of the Cabinet Minister’s brother who
once asked me: “How I could do anything so foolish
as to live in a harem?”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a poor compliment to one of Turkey’s greatest
statesmen, and to my hostess, his distinguished
daughter.</p>

<p class='c012'>But when I found that Roget’s “Thesaurus” gives
as synonym for a harem, “a house of ill fame,” I
understood!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Turkey, however, was crushed, defeated and, at
Sèvres, humiliated. Were we not courting disaster
by such unjust terms? If we remove the foot holding
them down—but ever so slightly—will they rebound
and strike?</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot understand,” I said to one of their
delegates, “how a Turk could be found to sign such a
Treaty.” For always, with all their faults, I had
known them proud.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Had we not signed,” he answered, “the Greeks
would have entered Constantinople, and God knows
when we could have driven them out. What does it
matter, the Treaty will not be ratified.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To keep out the Greeks, to save bloodshed! Maybe
he was right.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At least, we are set free from Germany,” they
said; and there is little we could not have asked then
for such security.</p>

<p class='c012'>They would have allowed Great Britain any privileges,
any concessions, all sovereign rights, if only we
had not permitted the occupation of Smyrna! When
the Dutch <i>pasteur</i>, M. Lebouvier, sent the <i>Times</i> a
full description of all the hideous bloodshed, the
saturnalian orgies, and the riot with which the Greeks
celebrated their triumphal entry, it was <i>suppressed</i>—and
Englishmen do not know!</p>

<p class='c012'>Consternation, despair, and anger were the order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>of the day. Those hitherto most apologetic for the
part played by Turkey in the war, were now ready to
glory in what they had done. A million and a half
Turks enslaved by 300,000 “servant” Greeks! Can
such things be?</p>

<p class='c012'>In Constantinople a mass meeting of 250,000
people was held at the Byzantine Hippodrome,
flags and banners were draped in black, women sobbed
as at a funeral. They were <i>mourning</i>, indeed, for the
city they were afterwards accused of having burned!</p>

<p class='c012'>By what deplorable influence were we thus moved
to attempt what would practically have meant the
extermination of Turkey? The magic name of Venizelos
is not enough! Again and again, the friends
of Turkey have asked why? But we do not know
whether British action was deliberate or the result of
an incredibly big blunder!</p>

<p class='c012'>M. Kemal Pasha’s great victory changed the face
of affairs. Few in England had seemed to care what
happened to this band of “rebels”; only a month
before his victory, even our Intelligence Officers thought
he would easily be beaten by the Greeks. Few had
even heard of his three and a half years exile in the
mountains!</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile, at home, we paid little heed, and scant
courtesy, to the three Ambassadors from Angora, who
came to negotiate peace. Békir Sami Bey’s confidential
conversations with the ex-Prime Minister about the
Soviet Government were handed on to M. Krassine.
Youssouf Kemal Bey, indeed, obtained a hearing, but
nothing was done. Fethi Bey (the Minister of the
Interior, sent as a last resource) was told, and that was
true, that Lord Curzon was seriously ill, but that no
one “counted” in England except Mr. Lloyd George.
Naturally, he asked the Premier for an audience, which
was “promised,” but never given!</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Incivility does not pay.</i> It is too expensive a
luxury for the greatest of nations. This level-headed
Turk, accepting such treatment with all the dignity of
his race, found many <i>other</i> things to praise in this
country. “The English,” he said, “understand only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><i>one</i> form of propaganda—the sword!” But of our
institutions, our Parliament, our clubs, and the marvellous
acting of Miss Sybil Thorndike in “Jane Clegg,”
he said much, and nothing but praise, in Angora!</p>

<p class='c012'>As a woman who has received the greatest kindness
and courtesy from the Turks, my resentment, on behalf
of Fethi Bey, was expressed with unmeasured indignation.
His mission was <i>not</i> taken seriously; the Government
dared to show him the cold shoulder!</p>

<p class='c012'>For his part, most graciously he suggested that I
should come over to Angora myself, to the cradle of
the Nationalist movement, and see the hero of the
Nationalists.</p>

<p class='c012'>But for his ever-ready assistance it would have
been useless to have made the attempt. When, in
Angora, he renewed his apologies for all the discomfort
I had endured, but I told him the journey itself had
been a privilege, for it enabled me to see with my own
eyes what his people had been driven to endure.</p>

<p class='c012'>No, I could never have forgiven myself if, in a
moment of weakness, I had been discouraged by the
chivalry of the British officials and allowed them to
persuade me to stay at home.</p>

<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>MALTA: THE NAME I WAS TO HEAR THROUGHOUT ANATOLIA</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Our</span> first stopping-place was Malta, the name I was
destined to hear from one end of Anatolia to the
other.</p>
<p class='c012'>Was it not of Malta that Angora was born; and
since “the trouble” in the East, Malta has been
turned into a universal dumping-ground for officers’
wives and refugees. Whenever M. Kemal Pasha lifts
his little finger, or Rauf Bey opens his mouth, the women
and children are bundled off to Malta. They return,
indeed, on any excuse, at the first opportunity (as
why should they not?), until a panic-stricken Government
again sends them to exile. One lady with us
had done the trip in this way four times!</p>

<p class='c012'>Constantinople, without our women, makes one
wonder if it were so wise as it appears, thus to play
for safety! After all, cannot the Englishwoman
endure what the Russian, Greek and Armenian are
left to put up with? If the husband is in danger,
should not his wife be with him? “We want to
‘protect’ our women,” I had been told, and there is
no finer ideal than chivalry. But, after Constantinople,
I would suggest that we women also “want to
protect our men!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Softening, perhaps, the frankness for which my
“French” education has been so often held responsible,
I would only say: “There are alluring distractions!”</p>

<p class='c012'>And in marriage I pin my faith upon the Italian
proverb: “Keep to the women and cows of your own
country.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The utter destitution of so many members of the
old Russian aristocracy, has not deprived its women of
their temperamental charm. It has provided them
with an occasion (genuine enough, God knows) for
tears no British youth can resist, unmoved as he will
remain under the fiercest shell-fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet one Englishman told me his Russian wife had
taken every penny he possessed, and vanished—he knew
not where. Another “fears it is only a matter of time.
His ‘noble’ wife cannot be expected to put up with
Clapham, and when something better turns up, he will
be discarded.” One married “a sweet, soft voice” out
of sheer loneliness; and another, foolish and rich,
clothed in priceless ermine the lady he met “at a
bar!” There is no need to dwell on other, less
honourable, “consequences” of such “casual”
meetings.</p>

<p class='c012'>At every corner in Constantinople the “bar”
invites the busy and the brave to cocktails or a
whisky, an example we have given the “despised”
Turk, who had the wisdom to make Angora “dry.”
Here, too, is the best of chances for pro-Greek propaganda,
as our men meet no “Turkish” women, who
are “really” safe in the bosom of their families. One
is tempted, almost, to hope that for them the day of
“freedom” may be postponed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Facing this ugly side of what an “Army of Occupation”
must always entail, does the Englishwoman
who absolutely refused to “leave” need to stand on
her defence? “Vanity Fair,” moreover, may serve to
remind us that there were English women near Waterloo;
and do our present generation require such careful
wrapping in cotton-wool, while they are, nevertheless,
too often left unprotected in the drab, hum-drum life
of a modern “business” world.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is remarkable, again, to reflect that every Turk
one meets, who really “counts for something” in
Angora, is a “Malta” man. If M. Kemal Pasha
believed in decorations, surely a special medal would
have been devised for those who had “visited”
Malta.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>As a prison, it is agreeable enough, though the
climate strikes one as enervating. The sun shines,
even brightly, for the greater part of the year, and
sunshine softens the captive’s lot! Had I never
visited the island I should have soon learnt to know
“the sights,” for in so many homes of Angora, Maltese
picture postcards are displayed, almost like holy
relics: Valetta, the “Chapel of Bones” (a barbaric
idea), the Mahommedan cemetery, the cathedral, and
the landing-stage. Everywhere, too, are the fair
ladies of Malta, whose head-dresses closely resemble
the Turkish tcharchaff.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Angelus had sounded as I first entered the
cathedral, to find myself amidst long rows of black-veiled
women, reverently kneeling on the cold inlaid-marble
floor, their heads bent in prayer, their fingers
counting the beads as they recited their rosaries.
The native type is dark-skinned, almost Mongolian,
but they all speak English. For are they not British
subjects, paid in British money, and entitled to our
protection? There was talk, indeed, of extending
the cover of “Nationalism” to them also; but,
personally, I still felt everywhere, and all the time, that
calming atmosphere of order, happiness, and prosperity
that is brought by the British flag.</p>

<p class='c012'>How is it, then, that we have so consistently failed
to quiet the Turkish storms? Of course, every one
of the “powers” has been involved, each playing for
its own hand, striving to end or prolong the war in
its own interests.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is well known that the Turk himself has above
all committed one crime—he has kept Constantinople!</p>

<p class='c012'>Bent on a policy of peace (!) we undertook to disarm
Turkey; but the mission despatched to Anatolia
for this purpose could, or would, not accomplish its
task. Then in May, 1919, despite the Mudros Armistice,
we allowed the Greeks to occupy Smyrna! In March
of the following year, came the English <i>coup d’état</i>!</p>

<p class='c012'>The highest personalities—generals, important
officials, anyone suspected of sympathy with the
Nationalists—were arrested, placed in the hold of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>man-of-war, for internment at Malta. All were taken
on mere suspicion, thrust into prison without trial!</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet the <i>naïveté</i> of the whole proceeding is almost
<i>more</i> puzzling than its high-handed injustice! These
dangerous men (!), supposed to be plotting against
Great Britain, are all huddled together, and left to
their own devices, for two years—and then released!
Were we afraid? Did we repent? Will Government
never <i>pursue</i> one policy to its logical conclusion?</p>

<p class='c012'>I could but “wonder about” these things as I
knelt in prayer. Clouds of incense have filled the
cathedral, the Blessed Sacrament is safely returned
to the tabernacle, the huge candles are extinguished,
and the veiled ladies are reverently leaving the dimly-lighted
church. Cannot faith bring peace?</p>

<p class='c012'>“There must be peace.” I, who have faith in
the spoken word, will declare it, everywhere and all
the time, and will count him traitor who utters a
word to the contrary. But I will tell them in Angora
that “I am sorry for” Malta!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Fethi Bey, Minister of the Interior, carries his comfortable
Turkish philosophy to the last extreme.
Whatever happens, he will say that “It might have
been worse.” In Malta, he acknowledged that he
would have preferred greater comfort, but, then,
“he <i>might</i> have been much more uncomfortable!”
In any case, he seized upon the chance to learn English,
and learnt it remarkably well. It is best, he believes,
to understand an enemy; and, to that end, you must
learn his language. Of Mr. Lloyd George, he declared
that “Turkey owes him a debt of gratitude we can
never repay.... But for the occupation of Smyrna,
and the Malta <i>coup d’état</i>, there would have been no
Nationalists. But for your Prime Minister we might
all of us have been vassals. Indeed, we owe him a
great deal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When I asked him what to expect in Angora, he
warned me that “I must not look for the luxuries of
the Savoy.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“Well, I can leave our jazz bands without one
pang,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But you may find worse things in Angora than
Jazz bands.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Men like Fethi Bey, ready to meet all emergencies
without complaint, make the right material to face the
problem of Reconstruction, in a country ruined from
end to end; and what a comfort it is to meet a man
without a grievance!</p>

<p class='c012'>When I attempted to sympathise with him for
having to ride, because no motor could take these
snow-blocked roads, he declared that “exercise would
do him good.” When his horse stumbled, “it might
have been worse.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet, on <i>my</i> account, he apologised again and again
for the condition of Angora; and I could only compare
his humorous comparison with the Savoy, to Dr.
Réchad’s strange attempt at consolation: “You
certainly won’t need any evening dresses.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is, no doubt, the gift for always making the best
of a bad bargain, that works for peace in the Turkish
home. Your husband is not perfect, but “he might
be worse”; the food is bad, but there might not be
any; if the rooms are not clean, “we have known dirtier.”
It is an “accommodating” point of view!</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a story by Nasreddin Hodja, the great
Turkish wit, which happily illustrates this racial
characteristic. The Anatolian lived in constant terror
of a vociferous wife, though no doubt he often reflected
that there were worse women in the world. One day,
however, someone told him that she had fallen into
the river, and was being carried away by the tide.
“Don’t worry,” said he, with a stoic’s calm, “she
will go against it. She always does.”</p>

<p class='c012'>On another occasion, this man of wit had carried a
basket of figs to the lame Timur, on an official visit
of respect. Timur amused himself by throwing the
fruit in the Hodja’s face; but at each blow he cried out:
“Allah is Great.” When asked why he so often praised
God, he answered: “My wife wanted me to bring
you apples.” Since Timur was privileged, if it pleased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>him, to strike the guest, he “thanked God” that he
had chosen <i>the smaller</i> and lighter fruit.</p>

<p class='c012'>As for my own mission in Malta, I had really come
to buy a British flag!, as Messrs. Cook’s manager at
Naples had supplied “everything” but just that.</p>

<p class='c012'>For years I have never travelled without a Union
Jack. The idea of undertaking so long and dangerous
a journey without it, filled me with strange foreboding.
Everywhere on the Front I had my “flag.” In a state
of coma at the military hospital, the nuns were in great
distress because I had expressed a wish to be buried in
the flag, which, being under my pillow, was nowhere to
be found! Naturally, in Paris I had foreseen my need.
But the registered trunk, booked to Rome, had fallen
on evil days, and there will be no luck for the “thief,”
who is probably polishing his boots with my sacred relic!</p>

<p class='c012'>At first, I seemed unable to escape the lace-makers
of Malta; and when, following the direction of a naval
officer, I found myself at last in a real “Harrod’s
Store,” my luck, also, was still out. At the Army and
Navy, the managing director declared they had “no
sale for Union Jacks.”... Each man possessed his
own. He dared not sell me the firm’s flag, for an order
to hoist it might be given at any moment; and, if he
failed to obey, he would very likely be driven out of
the island!</p>

<p class='c012'>As a last resource, I drove to a man said to have
“flags for hire.” By this time I was too frenzied
with disappointment to conceal my eagerness, and
they promised me one for £7! Luckily enough, excitement
prompted me to unfurl my treasure then and
there, to find myself gazing, in mute astonishment,
upon the Stars and Stripes! “Isn’t it the same thing?”
cried the impostor, as I flung myself out of the shop.</p>

<p class='c012'>But time and tide wait for no woman, and I must
silence my superstitions, to join the <i>Pierre Loti</i> once
more. Taking a last look on the fortifications of
Malta, my thoughts turned to the imprisoned Turks,
and my heart was filled with shame.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day, perhaps, the Turks may hold Malta
sacred, for assuredly the cream of her people were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>gathered there. One might almost have thought that
such men as Prince Said Halim (late Grand Vizier),
Rauf Bey, Fethi Bey, Hussein Djahid, and my admirable
Angora guide,) Vely-Nedjdat, had been carefully
selected to keep each other company.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. Stan-Harding once said of her eight and a half
months in a Soviet prison: “At least I had this
advantage, I met the best people in Russia.” As her
hearers seemed puzzled by such a statement, she
added, “They were all, naturally, in prison!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I must tell them, in Angora, that England, at least,
has always honestly tried to put right her own wrong-doings,
and one day (may it be soon!) she will “redeem”
herself to them also.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. H. G. Wells somewhere describes the strange,
great love we often feel for those we have deeply
wronged—the wife, the friend, the enemy. May it
not, at the long last, be so “after the war?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Who knows if, indeed, this be not the dark hour
before the dawn, of our nation’s friendships—with those
we have been led to hate?</p>

    <div>ATHENS—“WE HAVE LOVED HELEN; MUST WE DIVORCE HER?”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>If</span> only it were always calm, how delightful it would
be to travel by sea!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>From</span> Malta to Athens, indeed, is not a long run;
but when every moment you are tossed from side to
side, at the mercy of all the winds in heaven, most
things have a disagreeable look. As we approached
the brown and arid coast of this historic peninsula,
I thought how unjust it seems to have driven the
Ottoman Greeks out of fertile Turkey to a fatherland
that cannot feed them. You cannot obtain blood from
a stone, nor fruitful crops from an unfertile soil.
What is Greece to do for these poor people, who
cannot all turn merchants or moneylenders?</p>

<p class='c012'>Before landing at Piræus, with my Italian escort,
I took the precaution to investigate the rate of exchange—250
drachmas to the £1 sterling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is strange,” said I, “that we have none of this
inconvenience in Turkey. There one always gets a
fair ‘exchange,’ and no worry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The steamer slows down to anchor, and on all
sides we are hustled by modern Shylocks. “Two
hundred and fifty drachmas for a pound,” I asked,
“how many for five shillings?” And the Greek
answered: “Fifteen.” “Come and listen to this
Greek arithmetic,” I called in Italian; but the man
understood me, and let out a hearty laugh. Though
I turned from him, without malice, he promptly raised
his price from fifteen to forty-five (!), and in the end I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>bought drachmas enough to take us ashore, hoping
for better terms on land.</p>

<p class='c012'>I shall never forget that day at Piræus—heat and
dust, flies and refugees. Could a more terrible combination
be imagined? All along the quays lay these
wretched folk, many of them fast asleep, with armies
of flies crawling over them. If by chance one stumbled
over a dusky body, which it was not easy to distinguish
from the soil, a cloud of flies rose to smite
you in the face—the most fatal of disease-carriers!
The brown-faced women, dirtier even than the Neopolitans,
now crowded round us, offering cakes and
sweets from which they were every moment obliged
to brush off thick coatings of flies, that once more
struck one in the face or settled over my shoulders.</p>

<p class='c012'>My Italian escort had, meanwhile, kindly procured
a newspaper to act as fan, and now, hurriedly brushing
away these horrible pests, he took a silk handkerchief
out of his pocket to cover my neck. “What a
magnificent husband you will make for someone,” I
said, smiling with gratitude; and he blushed with
all the charm of his twenty-one years.</p>

<p class='c012'>In another moment my eye fell on the hard brown
faces and big “Jewish” noses of the moneylenders,
forcing a smile as they call on you to “buy.” They
have very much the same expression as Southern
Italians; keeping one eye, it would almost seem, to
make a pleasant impression on possible purchasers,
while the other betrays the keen and swift reckoning
of profits to the uttermost farthing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Seated behind little tables topped with boxes of
glass, they are eagerly displaying their filthy paper
money; haggling, arguing, smiling, and cheating you
in one breath! Surely no type of humanity could
carry us further from the heroes of our schoolday
imaginings!</p>

<p class='c012'>Wearied with fly-dodging, in fact, I had scant
energy left for a “good bargain,” over this “paper
filth” for honest English sterling.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sympathy now prompted me to ask the Italian
Whether his eyes were not in pain; and, by the power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of auto-suggestion, the inquiry caused my own to ache
as they had never ached before. Before we landed the
captain had given me a solemn warning on no account
to rub my eyes, however tormented by the continual
glare of a bright sun on white houses, or I should be
certain to “catch an incurable eye-disease and go on
‘weeping’ to the end of my days.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never, never speak of disease again,” I had
answered. “Misfortunes come quickly enough, without
our going to fetch them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Fortunately even the flies could not make it a
<i>long</i> journey from Piræus to Athens; and we could
glance in passing at the quaint and not unattractive
bookstalls, now showing large photographs of modern
“Heroes”—the Greek generals! After all, they had
done their best. <i>They</i> were no more responsible for
the mistakes of <i>their</i> Government, than we are for ours.</p>

<p class='c012'>Taking train for the last part of our route, we were
packed like sardines among the ugliest possible types
of human beings one could imagine; but, luckily,
soon alighted at a station whose magic name should
thrill the dullest heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>We were in Athens! But the Italian could only
exclaim: “What women!” I reminded him that
they were, after all, descended from Helen of Troy,
for whose beauty the world in its youth made war.
Yet it seemed almost a heresy to name that name in
such surroundings.</p>

<p class='c012'>If only one could show all men what a tragedy is
here.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is something I long to do,” I told my companion.
“I would summon crowds of my countrymen
and my countrywomen to the Albert Hall and
borrow the magic tongue of Mr. Lloyd George, to draw
their tears for our dear Christian brethren at the mercy
of the brutal Turk! And then a deputation of
these money-changing Greeks should be brought in
to stand at the Welshman’s right hand and his left!”</p>

<p class='c012'>How many, even then, would read, mark, and
digest the grim comment?</p>

<p class='c012'>But the Italian laughed again and again at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>picture my words suggested. I could only murmur:
“What is it, to be twenty-one!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I believe we went into every church in Athens;
for ever since I left home I have never passed a
church or a mosque without sparing a moment to
enter and pray for peace. “It will do no good,” said
my companion, and I replied: “It will do no harm.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We saw many women also at prayer, kneeling before
their Ikons—not for victory, but in sad thoughts of
their own dead, and for help and strength to bear their
own terrible sorrows.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once the Greek Pope came up and spoke to us,
supposing, to my young Italian’s honest confusion,
that we were man and wife. The spirit moved him to
denounce, in very broken French, the treachery of
England; and, whether or no it was from heat and
fatigue, or from the sight of those broken-hearted
women, something seemed to burst in my throat and
bitter tears streamed from my tired eyes. I could
not tell him <i>I</i> was English. I could not find words
or strength, such as came to me later in Anatolia, to
plead a little for England by putting some of the
blame on M. Venizelos.</p>

<p class='c012'>While the Italian discreetly left me—to kneel before
an Ikon in silent prayer to the Man of Sorrows—I
could but stand and suffer the attack upon my beloved
country, choking with tears of humiliation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alas, the incident does not stand alone. When
taking tea in an hotel, I asked my companion to make
inquiries about the best place to buy a Union Jack,
and the proprietor seized the opportunity to give us
<i>his</i> opinion of British honour.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now I never heard, throughout the whole of Anatolia,
a single Turk speak of Britain or Mr. Lloyd George
as these Greeks both spoke. It is a pity that some of
our pro-Greek politicians were not with me—to learn
the <i>real</i> value of all they have undertaken for their
Christian brethren.</p>

<p class='c012'>In that church, maybe, I was so cruelly overcome
because the broken-hearted women had stirred in me a
glowing vision of the great Pericles. “For me,” was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>his proud boast, “shall no man wear mourning. I
have not shed one drop of human blood.” Could any
ruler leave this earth with a nobler record? Could
any conceive for himself so fine an epitaph?</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Our</i> rulers, and Venizelos, have wasted the precious
blood of Europe to flatter their personal vanity and
nurse an idle imperialism for Greece; and when
everything goes wrong they have only to resign!</p>

<p class='c012'>I had determined to ascend the Acropolis, whatever
the effort to reach the top, and refused even to be
discouraged when at the very entrance our driver pulled
up and informed us that “it was forbidden” to drive
within.</p>

<p class='c012'>It did not occur to me to protest; but we had
scarcely walked twenty yards up the steep ascent when
a carriage (containing the captain and his daughter) and
then another carriage (!) drove by. Naturally indignant,
we returned to ask the man what he meant. To evade
argument, he disingenuously explained: “It would
need two horses to get up there, and I have only one.”
The subterfuge only infuriated me the more, and when
he had six times sturdily refused to obey orders, I
simply seized the miserable little being by the shoulders
and shook him like a rat. Violence proved the only
way, and we had no more trouble with him!</p>

<p class='c012'>It is horrible, in such hallowed surroundings, to be
haggling about money; but, of course, we were
cheated over our change!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never mind,” said the Italian, “let the creatures
rob us. Gentlemen cannot fight with grooms.” And
as I looked at the exquisite profile of this young Venetian
against the Athenian skies, I could fancy myself
accompanied by one of the old Patricians, amidst his
degenerate, money-changing descendants.</p>

<p class='c012'>Almost in silence we wandered over the ruins of a
civilisation whence came the highest culture of the
world. I felt, indeed, as if I had been born too late;
for what have <i>I</i> in common with the century in which
I live?</p>

<p class='c012'>To-day nations are not judged by their lyrics
that are the measure of their imagination, and without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>imagination the race must die. Our standards are
skill in commerce!</p>

<p class='c012'>Had I the art, whether of pen or brush, to pay fit
homage to this immortal rock, who would look or
listen? Could I invent yet one more machine to
“save time”—for making more money—the world
would be at my feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>Where shall <i>we</i> look for a Pericles, who hand our
laurels to the presiding genius of a “cash and carry”
<i>store</i>?</p>

<p class='c012'>There is no finer view of Athens than one can gain
from the Acropolis, as the city lies at its feet, like some
plain of brown paper dotted with green palms and the
little white houses drawn in chalk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here,” said I, “is the Greece of Oxford—of
Homer and Plato, of Æschylus and of Sophocles!
The magnificent traditions of an immortal past.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was in Oxford of classic memories, that I
first heard the Tales of Greece, first listened to her great
scholars telling of Andromache and Antigone in the
exquisite language of the finest literature in the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here, too, is the Greece of Byron—of Childe
Harold, and of the <i>Maid of Athens</i>!”</p>

<p class='c012'>How the voice carries in this clear atmosphere!
No wonder these ancient people would crowd under
the blue skies to every play, tragic or comic, that their
great dramatists could produce.</p>

<p class='c012'>And now, as the sunset colours—gold, scarlet,
violet, and purple—are glowing upon the immortal
rock, over the marble ruins, I marvel at “tiny”
Athens and her “vast” name.</p>

<p class='c012'>Alas, for Hellas and modern Greece!</p>

<p class='c012'>Had her own people been as faithful as Oxford
to the traditions of ancient Greece, what would have
been the Eastern Question to-day? And for some,
no doubt, it is this very honouring of Hellas that has
been responsible for our fatal pro-Greek enthusiasms.
If we recognise the superiority of the modern Turk,
loyalty to Plato, to Aristotle, and to Socrates must
forbid speech; gratitude to the lyrcis of Hellas must
tie the tongue. Orators and poets, artists and thinkers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>cannot forget. Hellas still lives and rules in the
Republic of Letters and Art.</p>

<p class='c012'>We understand Oxford; but for those who have
been on the spot, facts tell another tale and speak
with another voice. Where, in Greece to-day, are her
men of intellect or imagination, even her aristocrats
or her warriors? The millions spent in propaganda
may serve to prolong the legend, they cannot alter
facts. To visit, with glowing anticipations, this land
of our dreams, means the awakening to bitter disillusion.
Those only are still blind who will not see.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Angora I could but plead for England: “We
have loved Helen; must we divorce her?”</p>

<p class='c012'>More than the eloquence of Venizelos, more than
the gold of Zakaroff, more than any pity for Christian
martyrs; it is our age-old loyalty to the civilisation
to which we owe our visions and our ideals—that has
led us so woefully and so wilfully astray. Is there not,
after all, some “merit” in British “fair play” to
a “lost cause?”</p>

    <div>SMYRNA: A PICTURE OF DESOLATION</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>For</span> Orientals, the sky is no less variable and uncertain
than the political horizon. In the space of an hour
the sea, calm as a lake, has been transformed to a
roaring torrent.</p>
<p class='c012'>Smyrna in the distance, and we are battling forward
through one of the worst storms of the season. The
steamer dances like a cork on the foam, while long
sheets of rain drench the decks, huge waves washing
into staterooms soak the carpet, thunder and lightning
rage overhead; as in the grim battle of life, we can
but hold on till the clouds pass.</p>

<p class='c012'>Soon, indeed, are the waters about us again at
rest, and the town rises to our view. A city burnt to
the ground? Where are the ruins of which we have
heard so much? Of a sudden the heavens answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the lightning begins to play over the land, the
“shells” of houses and their hollow interiors stand out
clear before us—a picture of horror and desolation
it would be hard to match. As we draw nearer it is
no longer necessary for us to gaze upon the devastation;
the blind could catch a strong smell of burning (not
in itself disagreeable) and, in a few moments, we see
that even the rains have not entirely quenched the
clouds of smoke still rising from the tobacco factories.</p>

<p class='c012'>Turkey considers herself at war, and red tape still
prevails. But now one does not find many Turks who
can speak English, though, strange to relate, there are
quite a few English here still. We are not issuing
passports to Turks!</p>

<p class='c012'>Seeing my Turkish letters (better these than a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>British passport), the passport officer sent his secretary
with me and my luggage to the Vali’s (<i>i.e.</i>
governor’s) house. The Angora Ambassador in Rome,
Djelalledine Arif Bey, had also telegraphed to the
Vali that I was on my way, and requested that, as some
acknowledgment of what I had done for Turkey, I
should be given all possible facilities and a right
royal welcome! The Vali, without doubt, did all he
could.</p>

<p class='c012'>I inquired of the officer what kind of man was the
Vali, sure that the measure of his enthusiasm or his
indifference would clearly reveal whether the master
was liked by his men and thus provide me with a peep
into the unknown. The man’s eyes positively lit up as
he replied. It was clear that I should be well received
by a good man. “He was sent to Malta, you know,”
concluded the officer, as if that were enough. And,
though I was English, I understood. I believe that
the word “Malta” may soon be safely translated
“patriot.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I suppose it needed some courage to come to Turkey,
braving the Custom house and passport officers even
with special “protection”; but I met with no difficulties
whatever. My companion only seemed puzzled
by my name being the same as my father’s! A
Turkish woman, of course, would be, <i>e.g.</i>, Aïché Hanoun,
wife of Rechid Pasha, or daughter of Zia Pasha.
But have no foreign women, bearing their father’s
name, been through the Smyrna customs, or am
I not only the first British woman to visit Angora, but
the first British spinster to enter Turkey?</p>

<p class='c012'>Something of all I owed to the Vali for his “speeding
up” of the customary formalities was forcibly
impressed on me when I went back for my Turkish
papers, to find one of my fellow-passengers, a Frenchman,
still struggling with his passport and the custom
duties.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Vali’s konak (or palace) which I had long known
from pictures, looks on to public gardens where the
band plays every afternoon a strange mixture of
Oriental and European music. It was delightful to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>hear Oriental tunes again, if indeed one can call
Oriental music <i>a tune</i>. Anything in the major key
seems out of focus with Turkey, its atmosphere, its
scenery, and surroundings. The more one hears and
understands the piercing melancholy of these refrains
the more one loves them; and I am particularly
grateful to all those Turks (M. Kemal Pasha included)
who entertained me with the true native work.</p>

<p class='c012'>In front of the marble steps of the palace Greek
flags are used as mats—dishonoured and trampled
with Turkish mud! Such a symbol of conquest
struck me as neither generous nor happy; but I soon
found that it had been adopted without the knowledge
of the chivalrous Vali, who immediately put a stop to
the custom.</p>

<p class='c012'>His palace is lavishly supplied with fine carpets,
always the chief item of furniture in the East, while
there are many chairs and a handsome desk in the
waiting room.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Welcome to our shores, dear miss,” said the Vali.</p>

<p class='c012'>And that he might at once disassociate me from
English policy, I replied: “That is certainly a charming
welcome from a Malta man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Malta to me,” said my host, as he took my hand
like an old friend, “is still incomprehensible. What
can have happened to England?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I understand it, dear Excellency, no better than
you can. The more I hear of what has taken place in
Turkey during the last few years, the more often I
repeat your own words. What, indeed? To an
Englishwoman who loves her country, it means great
sorrow; but this unreasoning hostility towards your
people must stop. That is why I am going to Angora.
After my visit, at any rate, the Turks shall see that
<i>one</i> Englishwoman can stand out against injustice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you a thousand times, dear miss,” was
his reply, as the attendant brought in coffee and
cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Like all the Nationalist leaders, the Vali is a young
man. He looks, in fact, about forty, and comes from
an Albanian family. Of medium height, slight and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>dark, good-looking despite his glasses, and intelligent;
he is, above all, an honest and kindly gentleman.
If all the “fanatics” of Angora are of this description,
I shall have nothing to fear. Abdul Halik Bey
is a great admirer of England.</p>

<p class='c012'>Begging I should not hesitate to ask for anything,
assuring me that no service possible to render will be
neglected, he called up the head of the police and three
of his officers to make my acquaintance. The Vali
explains that as Smyrna is in ruins, I must go to the
only existing hotel—a temporary establishment under
the care of Naim Bey, who had been the proprietor
of the two best hotels in Smyrna, now burnt to the
ground. This “temporary establishment” was the
town residence of the Spartallis and a very fine
mansion indeed!</p>

<p class='c012'>When I had said <i>au revoir</i> to the Vali, I paid my
return visit to the chief of the police, Zia Bey—a handsome
and very energetic young man of about thirty-two,
who speaks only Turkish.</p>

<p class='c012'>Again we drank coffee. He pointed to the picture
of M. Kemal Pasha above his desk, and made a little
speech about him, which, alas, I could not understand.
As comment, however, I clapped my hands,
adding: “M. Kemal Pasha Chok Guzel” (<i>i.e.</i>, very
beautiful), which evidently pleased him. He could see
at least that my spirit was willing to pay tribute to his
national hero although the Turkish words failed me.
Throughout Anatolia, whenever at a loss for words, I
adopted this phrase; never once did it fail to convey
the meaning I intended—congratulations for his
magnificent victory.</p>

<p class='c012'>Zia Bey has published some detective novels—from
his own personal experiences. Like the man himself,
they seem to have secured wide applause.</p>

<p class='c012'>He, too, like the Vali, is a stern enemy to delay,
and often receives several people at once. He will
listen to all you have to say, while the business of an
earlier caller is still to be executed. Practical and
courteous though such a custom may be, it obviously
has its drawbacks. I wonder what would happen had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>I any advice to ask, or any suggestion to make, on
what to me at least might seem private and confidential
matters. Thanks to this system, however, it has been
my privilege to meet at the Vali’s, or at Zia Bey’s,
many notables of Smyrna, whom I might not have
found time or occasion to visit.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day when drinking my daily coffee with Zia
Bey, he handed 20,000 Turkish pounds to a French
merchant. A policeman, he explained, “found this
in your rifled safe.” The merchant was so astonished
that he spoke to me about it, adding: “Would they
have been returned to me in any other land?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Every day, after calling upon the Vali, I used to
visit Zia Bey. To the Vali, of course, I could speak in
French, but to Zia Bey I seldom went further than a
repetition of praise for M. Kemal Pasha. It is not
words that count when the heart is following the
dictates of truth.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the hotel I could only be accommodated by the
dismissal of another guest. Men were sleeping everywhere—in
the drawing-room, sitting-rooms, bedrooms,
three, four, and six in a room, grateful to find anywhere
to lay their heads. To my lot fell one of the best rooms
in the house, containing a sofa as well as a bed large
enough for four. I felt very guilty, but what could
I do? I was the only woman!</p>

<p class='c012'>To this improvised hotel everyone in Smyrna comes
sooner or later, if not for accommodation, at least for
meals and “light” refreshment. The country, of
course, is dry, but the guests walk round the laws as
cleverly as they do in the U.S.A. Americans are, perhaps,
the chief offenders, and seem always able to bring in
with them whatever they require. If they are caught
Naim has to pay the damages! “Poor things,” he
remarked by way of comment, “they are so far from
their homes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Most unfortunately, the Turk’s kindness and consideration
for his customers is not withheld from the
flies. The Nationalist motto, “A free and independent
Turkey,” has certainly been granted them—they
go wherever they like, do whatever they like.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>They sit in thick layers on the table-cloth, they drown
themselves in your glasses, you swallow them with
your food; “and to think,” said a Danish merchant,
“these creatures have been fattening on corpses!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Whatever their nationality, all my neighbours
made the most chivalrous endeavours to shield me from
these pests. I was advised to sacrifice my bread as
a cover to my glass when not drinking. I always
refused water, and Naim Bey defied the law to give
me German wine.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day, exasperated beyond endurance, I procured
what the French call a “guillotine,” and successfully
slaughtered every fly that came within my reach.
The “Italian” gently inquired whether the corpses
were not more awful than the living insects.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At least,” I said, “they cannot bite or carry
microbes,” and I pursued the slaughter with a zeal
that astonished even myself. I even aimed at those
I saw walking over the South American’s arm, and hit
his nose! Without a smile, he courteously declared
that he did not mind what I might do to his nose,
“but you <i>will</i> be careful of my glasses, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can’t you <i>do</i> something?” I asked Naim one
day.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They will go away when it is cold,” he replied
with the philosophy of the true Turk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cure or endure is also <i>my</i> motto,” I told him,
smiling, “but I never endure before I’ve made a fine
attempt to cure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>On another occasion, my energies were not rewarded
with true <i>Christian</i> gratitude or tact. I was busy as
usual, when an orthodox lady who had given her
nationality as “Catholic,” and was staying in Smyrna
by special dispensation of the Turks, said to a Greek
neighbour: “Look at this lady slaughtering flies, as
her friends the Turks slaughter Christians.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Madame,” said I, “I have passed this morning
among the ruins to which your ‘Christians’ have
reduced this city.” I had yet to see the hideous
devastation in Anatolia!</p>

<p class='c012'>There were about two or three hundred business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>men in the hotel, waiting to learn their fate. They
divided themselves into three distinct groups, in three
different mess rooms. <i>First</i>, the silent, water-drinking,
go-to-bed-at-nine Turks, in the library. <i>Secondly</i>,
Americans, in the smoking-room, who left their allegiance
to prohibition on the other side of the Atlantic;
singing and dancing to the accompaniment of a banjo
till the small hours of the morning. <i>Thirdly</i>, at a
long table in the dining-room, sat the rest of us—principally
business men—Italian, Spanish, Dutch,
South American, Frenchmen, or Danes. My only
fellow-countryman informed me that among other
complications he had come to Smyrna to arrange, he
has somehow to explain away the disappearance of
50,000 gallons of pure alcohol, sent from Cuba to
Smyrna <i>via</i> New York. The officials in New York had
helped themselves to the precious nectar, and sent the
cargo on to Smyrna, refilled with water! Such are
the trials of prohibition!</p>

<p class='c012'>One and all, these men have but three topics of
conversation: (1) the senseless policy of Mr. Lloyd
George in sending the Greeks to Smyrna; (2) the
criminal desire of the Turks to abolish capitulations;
(3) the “probabilities” of likely successors to the deported
Greeks and Armenians in the business world.
It is assumed that Turkey cannot survive without the
assistance of some European power. The Turk is a
producer, not a merchant. The Italians affirm that
trade would flourish in a happier world if they were
given the vacancy. The Americans, however, dispute
this honour, whilst the Dutchman, supported by
a Dutch clergyman (born of French parents, but a
British subject, in the service of Holland, speaking all
three languages without an accent), declares the only
power that is “going to count” in Turkey is Great
Britain.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In spite of her deplorable and ill-advised policy,
her inexplicable treatment of the Turks, her protection
of the Greeks (which has made <i>them</i> more arrogant and
destestable  than ever), there is <i>something</i> in the British
national character which still commands respect and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>admiration. In six or eight months we shall see England
back in Turkey, stronger than ever. England is
<i>not</i> her government.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I believe he is right. There was a more practical
reason for his convictions than his deep affection for
his English wife.</p>

<p class='c012'>Holding no brief for Mr. Lloyd George, I still
scorn these men of finance as cowards for their unmeasured
abuse of the Premier.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you foresaw disaster so plainly,” I asked,
“why did you not protest?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Every Chamber of Commerce sent a petition to
Mr. Lloyd George,” was the reply, “which he put
into his waste-basket.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Naturally. As practical men, is that your idea
of a <i>protest</i>?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One of our biggest men, Mr. Patterson, went to
the Paris Conference on our behalf.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did he make himself heard? I assure you, if I
had <i>one</i> hundred pounds invested in this country,
instead of the hundreds of thousands your Scotsman
holds, the world would have heard something of <i>my</i>
visit to Paris!</p>

<p class='c012'>“You saw financial disaster and ruin ahead, yet
allowed yourselves to be talked into silence by M.
Venizelos!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Somehow, <i>these</i> men could not excite my pity.
They were themselves more to blame than Mr. Lloyd
George. With their huge financial backing, and vast
interests in Smyrna, it was actually in their power, and
theirs alone, to have kept out the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a quaint result of my sense of justice that,
in the French Secret Service, I am known as “a niece of
Mr. Lloyd George.” When the brilliant one-time
<i>chef de Cabinet</i> of Monsieur Briand published his violent
attacks on Lord Robert Cecil and our late Premier, he
also printed my replies. “He did not,” he kindly
explained, “consider there was a word of truth in
what I said, but he was unwilling to thwart an Englishwoman!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Shortly after the appearance of my “defence,” the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>correspondent of a big newspaper in Chicago spoke of
“my uncle,” Mr. Lloyd George. I protested, “not
because I should not be proud of the relationship,
but because I happen to have no such claim.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dear lady,” he replied, “don’t think I shall ever
want to spoil your little game.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Such a remark did not merit a serious answer, and
I allowed the matter to slide. I knew very well Mr.
Lloyd George would never lift a finger to help “his
niece,” for have I not four times appealed to him in
vain on matters of the greatest national importance?
Yet “his niece” will continue to defend him against
“unjust” attacks, and criticise him also.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Smyrna capitalists also did not love me because
I wrote: “The day is past when financiers can obtain
‘concessions’ for 500 Turkish pounds backshish
and then complain of the Turks for being amenable
to bribes. The happy day will never return when the
foreigner lived in Turkey without taxation, with next
to nothing to pay in rent, was charged one and sixpence
for a shooting licence, and had full control of money
and trade.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Turkey is now for the Turks, and the Capitalists
will have to recognise this or leave.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never again will Smyrna become the Aliens’ Paradise
it once was. Would anyone, for example, have
dared to offer the trams provided for Smyrna to any
other nation but Turkey? Why were there not
electric trams, instead of these wretched horse-boxes
drawn by underfed ponies? And the compartment
reserved for Turkish women was not even separated
by a partition, but by a sheet that once perhaps was
white!</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are men in this town,” I wrote, “who would
plunge Europe into war, to bring back the dear old
lazy-going Turk who made so charming a background
for our novels and plays. They would restore him for
no higher purpose than to fill their purses at his
expense.” At least, I said to these merchants: “If
you cannot ‘love’ my whip, you know, in your heart
of hearts, that I have spoken the truth. You should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>have a mighty respect for me, and I ask for nothing
more.” The South American answered: “Every
word you say <i>is</i> true, and we <i>all</i> admire you for it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Towards nightfall, however, my mind was occupied
by certain more personal anxieties. The Italian had
not yet even come to the hotel, and I could hear nothing
of him. I began to reproach myself with not having
attempted to extend the protection of my papers to him,
although, like the gentleman he is, he had already
refused my suggestion to that effect.</p>

<p class='c012'>I could only apply, as a last resource, to the Vali’s
secretary, who at once took me to the Caracol (<i>i.e.</i>, the
“lock-up”), where we found my friend in company
with the Frenchman we had already been pitying for
his struggles with passports. Neither of these young
men were known in Smyrna; neither of them had
secured permission from Angora to land; neither of
them were personally known to their Consuls; neither
of them were able to speak a word of Turkish. They
could not explain themselves, and were, therefore, to
be kept under arrest till further inquiries could be
made.</p>

<p class='c012'>“After all, in war-time did we not do worse things
than this?” I asked the enraged Frenchman, who was
declaring such treatment would make a <i>casus belli</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When I was serving your country and travelling
to San Remo with a special letter of recommendation
from the French Minister of War, I was detained for
forty-eight hours at Mentone, because they considered
my ‘Plato’s Republic’ a proof of sympathy with the
Bolshevists.” I was able, however, with the secretary’s
willing assistance, to liberate both my fellow-passengers
without further delay.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Naim Bey gave me many special privileges, no
doubt as the result of prompting from the same quarter.
He sent me up breakfast in the mornings, though his
servants were all “Catholics” (<i>i.e.</i>, Armenians, under
the Papal protection), and did not know their job.
I never could understand how he contrived to supply
me with milk, as the Greeks had killed most of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>cows; but I was no less heartily grateful for his permission
to use the Spartelli library, and for the reading-lamp
which he borrowed for me from an American.</p>

<p class='c012'>All these acts of kindness, however, were done with
such an appearance of ease that I even ventured upon
one more request.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Could I use the piano to accompany my Italian
friend?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He did not hesitate to banish the six occupants of
“mattresses” in the drawing-room from their domain
until we finished “La Tosca” and “Madame Butterfly.”
Then an American begged me to play the “Swannee
River,” and nearly broke down before he had even got
to the chorus.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did I not tell you,” said the sympathetic Naim,
“Poor things, they are so far away from home!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I suppose I should not be too severe upon these
merchants among the ruins of their past glory, and,
to do them justice, they are accepting defeat like good
sportsmen. The Dutchman is as merry as a cricket,
despite his £80,000 “gone west,” his thirty years’ work
undone for ever, his fine farm burnt to cinders.</p>

<p class='c012'>I wish he would make a book out of all he has seen
and done in this land of romance. No one knows it
better, and, if my own sympathies are apt to be with
the brigands from whom he has twice suffered capture
(because they only rob the rich), I have enjoyed few
men’s tales of adventure more than his. Good and
strong men are rare enough, and I know this one would
never forget a friend. If danger threatened, it would
only reach you over his dead body.</p>

    <div>BRITISH CHIVALRY!—BRAVE WOMEN A NUISANCE!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>“Women</span> are so absurdly brave,” said a charming
British official, “that is why they are such a nuisance.”</p>
<p class='c012'>He was seated at a small, improvised and over-crowded
bureau in one of the few remaining houses on
the Smyrna Quay. He had just sufficient of a Scotch
accent to make one see that he would stand no nonsense—an
asset, surely, in his position. Yet the
obvious and zealous concern for his own countrywoman
proved that, however carefully the calm exterior of
the Scot may hide his feelings, his heart beats strong
and true. He is no less proud, too, of his “women”
than any citizen of the States!</p>

<p class='c012'>But this able and active young man, master of any
emergency at a crisis, could not accept my point of
view about the Nationalist Turk. That, certainly,
was not <i>his</i> fault, for who is there to interpret this
“new” people to him? He only knows that, for the
first time, Turks have dared to express themselves, and—like
brave women—are becoming a great nuisance!
Under the good Hamid, these lazy people were easy
enough to manage. “Turkey for the Turks!” What
a monstrous notion! Yet one feels, nay knows, that
he has plenty of intelligence, will face facts, and learn
to accept the inevitable.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile, I, for my part, am throwing a most
unwelcome additional weight upon his already over-burdened
shoulders. He is clearly annoyed at my
having come so far, and, in his place, who would not
have felt the same?</p>

<p class='c012'>But, unfortunately for him, he knows very well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>that a woman who, despite difficulties well-nigh insurmountable,
has been able to reach Smyrna without
a British viza, means to get her way and will not be
lightly driven back.</p>

<p class='c012'>If only the man had adopted the bullying and supercilious
tone that becomes a uniform! One can so easily
meet the “correct” officialism, counter its attacks,
stand up to its incivility, and go one’s own way with a
clear conscience. But it was not to be with my Scotch
friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I admire your courage immensely,” he said with
a courteous grace, “but, pardon my asking, what is
the sense of it all?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I want to study ‘the movement’ at Angora, and
to see the national hero, M. Kemal Pasha.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it worth risking your life for that? Forgive
me, it does seem rather a wicked waste.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Outside his windows, on the calm waters of the
bay, rode warships of many nations. The bright sun
looked down, unkindly it almost seemed, upon the ruin
and desolation around us. The arms of England, France
and America were all there. Holland, he told me,
had begged in terror for the protection of a warship.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Terror of what?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you not heard, can you not see, we are on
the brink of war? To-morrow you will be going home
with the others. Our Government has given orders
for the immediate evacuation of all our people. Later
you will receive final instructions, and be told the
meeting-place. This time it is war. There is no help
for it. It has to come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He showed me a flashlight, well hidden in a corner
of that dilapidated office, which would send out its
news of “safety” when every Englishman had left
the town, and he, my friend, had followed them in a
boat with its oars muffled—if he were able to get away.
If not, well, he had done his duty!</p>

<p class='c012'>But I remained unmoved. “Do not worry about
me. I have made all my plans, and shall start to-morrow
for Angora. I know the risks, and I know,
too, that all will be well for me.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>At first, evidently, his official mind suspected that
I was playing with his nerves, idly boasting of what
no one would seriously attempt. When convinced,
however, that I really meant what I said, he banged his
fist on the table and just shouted:</p>

<p class='c012'>“By Jove, if you belonged to me, you should
<i>not go</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>How I hoped he had lost his temper! But no,
in another moment he was again all quiet concern,
courteously persuasive.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” said I, “I have reached here against long
odds. I have come entirely on my own responsibility,
and at my own expense. The Turks who met me here
will take care of me, not my family nor my Government.
Even war will not stop me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And when there is war,” he replied, with a note
of almost despairing entreaty, “for as there is a God
above, it will come this time. Think of it! A woman
absolutely alone among the Turks; not a European to
help her. Six months, at least, in a concentration
camp, illness, perhaps torture. God knows what will
happen to you!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall not be put into a concentration camp, for
there will be no war. I am going to stop it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was smiling now, which only added to his distress.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear young lady,” he cried, “keep your
courage for some wiser, finer cause. Britain needs
you.... Seriously, you are not going, are you?—And
the war!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall nurse the British soldiers, or else return——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You speak of the Turks as if you trusted them.
Is this wise?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed, yes. I know them. The only way to
treat a Turk <i>is</i> to trust him. He has never yet let me
down. Why should he now? Even at this crisis
you will find there is no other way but trust with the
Moslem.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course he was not convinced.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Charming theories, but dangerous in practice;
above all, dangerous for you. Go home. You can
see your friends again when things are more settled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Don’t think I don’t admire your pluck; I do. In all
my experience I never met a woman ready for greater
risk; but we value you too much to let you go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a wearisome line of attack. I could so
much more easily have dealt with violence from a
would-be dictator. I tried again, hoping to silence a
busy man.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please imagine you are an American,” I suggested,
“and that time is money.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Time is <i>not</i> money when a woman’s life is at
stake. Forgive me, your courage—which I shall never
forget—is immense, but you are not a sportsman!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is not fair to us—Englishmen! What will
the Turks think of us, allowing it? They will have
a mighty poor opinion of British chivalry. And we
do not deserve it! Would they let one of <i>their</i> women
do such a thing? We, too, protect our women!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was losing ground, at least <i>that</i> appeal hurt; but
I could not yield.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You need not worry,” I replied, with more unconcern
than I could really feel at the moment. “I
will see that they understand. They <i>do</i> know how
England cares for her women; but they know me,
what a determined customer I am. They will not
blame you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He played his last card, bashfully indeed, but with
a grim resolve that won my respect.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dear lady, I have no wish to be personal, but
you have driven me to it. You are not—ugly enough
to undertake this journey.... Go and see the
British Navy you love so much. We will look after
the Turks, and you too. Come and see them when we
have finished with them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I saw that I must not only be firm, but I must
speak, and speak plainly. “If any harm comes of it,”
I said, seriously enough, God knows, “it will be my
own fault. The Turk respects women who respect
themselves. Ten years ago I went to Asia Minor,
with a military escort, the only woman; but I was
absolutely safe all the time, everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>There was no more to be said. Discomfited, indeed,
by so much chivalry, I left him, intending, after all, to
wait and see if war were declared. But, fortunately, I
had given no promise, for to the Scotchman I knew
truth and honour were sacred things.</p>

<p class='c012'>In justice to the official attitude, it should be clearly
said that no one could be expected to understand what
I should have given up had I returned to England,
under orders, with the rest of my compatriots.</p>

<p class='c012'>What, after all, were the difficulties that I had overcome
in comparison with my real object—to reach
Angora? What matter if the family coffers, the purses
of my friends, and even editorial generosity, were one
and all closed against me? None should have on their
conscience that they had sent me to my death!</p>

<p class='c012'>My contract with the newspaper! It was “deliver
the goods and your reward shall be handsome.”
The goods, indeed, are delivered and, in a fashion,
made public. They have not, however, been acknowledged
as “woman’s work,” and the reward seems
still far to seek!</p>

<p class='c012'>I had not supposed that in journalism “the sex”
must suffer the double loss of justice and credit. The
articles were certainly not stamped with any plain
mark of a <i>feminine</i> special correspondent.</p>

<p class='c012'>Unfortunately, we are not in Turkey! where
women’s achievements have still the “novelty”
that can command a fine flourish of trumpets, where
no cry has been needed of “equal work—equal pay!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Had I foreseen, should I then have returned to
punish ingratitude? I think not. At such a moment
I could not forego the most thrilling chapter of the
story that has held me for so many years; ever since,
indeed, I used to climb on the knee of the dear being
whose name I bear, to hear him tell of his journeyings
to those Eastern lands—Japan and China, India and
Moslem Turkey.</p>

<p class='c012'>Many curious interpretations have been put upon
my interest in these peoples. The Turks themselves
have wondered how it came about.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is because they had been my friends long years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>before I ever set foot on their now familiar land. Its
colours, its beauty, its glorious summers and sunsets,
the fine thought and philosophy of its high-minded,
sober people, were known to me in the nursery, as
only a child can live in the imaginations stirred by
those it loves. They were always brothers to me,
the Orientals of India and Persia, Egypt, Arabia, and
Turkey. I would give much, indeed, to secure for
them the happiness they deserve for what they have
given to the culture and to the civilisation of the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>The stupidity of treating the Asiatic as an “inferior”
I could never understand. It is no less impolitic than
unjust. What a delight, in our century of semi-tones
and of commercialism, to talk with men like Tagore!</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>I take</span> daily walks in Smyrna, with one of the Vali’s
officers, chiefly among the ruins. The European part
of the town (save for a few houses on the quay and a
few hospitals, schools, and churches) has simply ceased
to exist. The empty “shells” of what were once fine
streets are a great danger to passers-by and must all
be blasted.</p>
<p class='c012'>When I told my guide that from the deck of the
<i>Pierre Loti</i> the town showed scarcely a sign of fire, he
promptly led me—for eight hours—through the most
horrible <i>débris</i>! Instructed to treat me with great
respect, he marched steadily ahead with all the gravity
of a funeral mute. He had been told, moreover, to
reconstruct, as it were, the whole city for my information,
and he was obviously determined to overlook no
detail. He pointed out exactly how the fire had been
planned, and why it had broken out too soon. Passing
the Stores, he laid a finger upon the very spots marked
by grenades that Greeks and Armenians had thrown.
There was a grim disgust and disdain in his last comment:
“And all this <i>funniness</i> is supposed to have
been done <i>by us</i>!”—a strange use of the word funniness.</p>

<p class='c012'>On another occasion, resting a moment among the
ruins of what had once been an altar, watching the poor
Turkish natives as they raked the <i>débris</i> for firewood,
we were suddenly surrounded by a most dismal procession
of limping cats and dogs, thin as boards, crying
with hunger and pain, homeless, maimed, and with
none to claim them or cherish their shrunken limbs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>I suggested that we should buy a little ether and send
them to their long sleep. My companion was shocked
beyond words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poor beasts,” he exclaimed, “have not they as
much right to be on God’s earth as we? Who are
we that we should dare to cut short their existence?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Naturally I did what I could to express all the
sympathy his words aroused; determining, nevertheless,
in my own mind, that I would beg the Englishman or
the Italian to accomplish this errand of mercy.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the same time, the incident only further excited
my deep interest in the strange mentality of a people
who claim the full rights of existence even for maimed
cats and dogs, and are yet held guilty by the whole
world of massacring millions of Christians for mere
sport.</p>

<p class='c012'>Later that day I was for the moment extremely
puzzled by the strange behaviour of all the inhabitants
within sight, which certainly seemed most <i>un</i>-Turkish.
“I have known your people for fifteen years,” I said
(only intending a mild joke), “and this is the first time
I have ever seen a Turk hurry! What is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are going to blast the ruins,” was my
companion’s calm reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>To my thinking it was, indeed, time to be off;
and I hopped away like the others, in and out among
the charred ruins, at one moment catching my heel,
at another tearing my skirt and coat. When, panting
and breathless, we at last reached comparative safety,
I laughingly asked my guide why he had given me no
warning. “You could have no idea whether I could
run like this at the last moment.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“His Excellency told me that you were to be
treated with the utmost respect,” was the solemn
reply!</p>

<p class='c012'>It was true that the day before I had been informed
that it was forbidden to take photographs among the
ruins, and I at once closed my Kodak. But in the
evening an apology arrived from the Chief of Police.:—“I
might photograph, when and where I pleased.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I can only suppose my guide believed that “Allah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>would guard me” when the blasting began; at least,
whatever was to be my fate, he was ready to share it!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>We have been wandering about the muddy streets
of the bazaar, immortalised by Pierre Loti. It is
here, in these little Turkish booths—the tinker’s,
tailor’s, and shoemaker’s, the meat-man’s, the baker’s,
and the sweet-seller’s—that the inhabitants of Smyrna
must do their shopping to-day. How can we think
of Frank Street and its vast European “emporium,”
now no more than a smouldering heap of crumbling
ruins?</p>

<p class='c012'>Town-planning is as yet unknown in Turkey. Here,
as elsewhere, the houses seem to be straggling upon the
hillside, forming an architectural patchwork far more
picturesque than the most correct symmetry.</p>

<p class='c012'>We are now to ascend Mont Pegasus, and though I
hate climbing, the sunset panorama of an Eastern city
will reward a greater effort than this. To look on the
fading sunlight in all its glorious magnificence of purple
and scarlet and mauve, is to know we are in the presence
of God; and if ever the world needed His guidance,
it surely must seek Him now.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That,” I murmured, “is how God meant us to
find His world—a life of sunshine, a death of beauty.
No fear, no shrinking before what must come to all;
but His glory reflected about us, as the sun’s beauty is
reborn for us in the infinite, waiting sea.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look up, and then turn your eyes down to
man’s work below our feet—black war, grey ruin and
desolation!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>An English lady, Mrs. de C——, the widow of a distinguished
British Minister in Teheran and Bucharest,
has just given me a more level-headed and <i>fair</i> description
of the Smyrna fire than I have yet heard from
any other eye-witness. Her husband was manager of
the Aidin Railway, and had the luck to unearth a
unique collection of priceless antiques along the route.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Tea was served in the entrance hall of their house in
the European quarter, one of the few still erect, which
reminded me of the British Museum. One could fancy
oneself among the treasures of the Parthenon, which
it has fallen to British hands to preserve.</p>

<p class='c012'>She told me she owed her home to the wind’s
kindness. “We were on the roof all night, watching
its varying directions, although it did not come our
way until about 2.30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> As the abandoned Greek
ammunition was all stored behind us, we could no
longer risk staying in the face of the wind. At the
same moment a flashlight from H.M.S. <i>Iron Duke</i>
began to play on the pier, and we realised that Admiral
de Brock was signalling for us to leave the town.
Pushing our way through a howling mob of men and
animals, we at last reached the waiting boat; but no
sooner were we on board than, to our relief, the wind
once more veered. There was a chance for one side
of the Smyrna Quay, on which stood the Aidin station.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In her judgment, the Turks acted throughout with
the greatest moderation. Everywhere in Anatolia
I found clear evidence that Greeks had indulged in
the worst type of barbarianism, amply sufficient to
justify any slight Turkish excesses that may have
occurred in Smyrna.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since her Greek household had all departed, Mrs.
de C—— was very busy “about many things”—dusting,
sweeping, and cooking. Nor were her sympathies
very keen with the Greek refugees, to many of whom
she had extended hospitality. They had accepted a
night’s lodging, and then decamped with sheets,
blankets, pillows, towels, and clothes!</p>

<p class='c012'>Lunch, however, had been served for her by a
“Catholic,” who cooked Turkish dishes to perfection.
“Catholic” is now the last word in “Nationality,”
covering a multitude of “pasts,” and saving
the “Christian” from having to answer awkward
questions.</p>

<p class='c012'>The “Catholic” who waits on me at the hotel was
an upholsterer in quite a large way of business. The
sewing-woman, whom I have occasionally employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>for odd jobs, though a Greek, is also “Catholic.” In
Angora these derelicts are self-styled “Catholic
Turks.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I have boarded the warship, despite the captain’s
fear of a woman’s pen. What would he find to say
about my <i>real</i> intentions? Most of us, happily, can
look on sailors of all nations, as I do, absolutely without
prejudice. For here, at least, none can capture
our laurels, and all the world loves a British sailor.</p>

<p class='c012'>Amidst the beautiful fittings of his luxurious cabin,
I was received by the captain with every mark of the
courtesy that is second nature to the real English
gentleman. He was a naval man to his finger-tips,
stamped all over with Nelson’s magic call to “Duty.”
For his magnificent achievements in the war, his V.C.
was indeed richly deserved; and yet, I wondered, is
it the wisest policy to expose this <i>real</i> “personage”
to the kind of actually trivial irregularities which in a
town like Smyrna a too formal officialism may so
easily mistake for grave affronts to our national
prestige?</p>

<p class='c012'>While in Smyrna I saw an example of such real
dangers—a mere nothing that might suddenly have
developed into a <i>casus belli</i>, though in this case any
serious disaster was, luckily, averted.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Turks had given the sailors from different
warships special permission to land on the quay without
the formality of going through the Custom House.
Unfortunately, certain Armenian girls saw their chance
to coax the sailormen into helping them to escape. I
am told that the British were adamant to tales of woe
that turned Americans, French, and Italians to putty;
but I will not believe it, for I prefer to think our men
had their share in defying the law to help women.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Turkish authorities, however, were, naturally
and properly, indignant at the deception, and gave
orders that in future everyone should land at the
Custom House. Most unfortunately, the order was
immediately carried out, without a warning to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>captain. When that personage came ashore next
morning, therefore, he found himself confronted by an
Anatolian peasant, rifle in hand, who actually slipped
in an extra cartridge under the great man’s eye.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our consul, of course, intervened, and the captain,
with his sword drawn, was permitted to land, ample
apologies being tendered in due course by a repentant
Vali.</p>

<p class='c012'>No more was heard of this incident; but with some
“big” men it would not have been allowed to end there.</p>

<p class='c012'>I admit that a warning should have reached the
captain; but Turks are proverbially careless about
official details. It was just bad luck, too, that some
petty officer was not the first to land, who could have
borne the indignity without loss of prestige, and
“arranged” matters for his chief; but if we must
appoint our “best” men to such a post, someone
smaller should be sent in advance to spy out the land.
Friction is bound to occur between our experienced
officers, statesmen, or diplomats (above all, if their
sense of humour is not very keen) and the primitive
Anatolians of young Turkey. We should, surely,
have been well advised in this matter to follow the
French way of employing “middle men” for a time.</p>

<p class='c012'>I love the casual freedom of Turkish customs, which
will suffer a train to be kept waiting for my private
comfort; but the characteristic may be extremely
trying on another occasion. Every virtue has its
pet vice!</p>

<p class='c012'>When I visited Turkey after the Balkan war our
steamer somehow “missed” the mouth of the bay,
and no one remembered the exact position of the
mines! As a matter of fact, the <i>Senegal</i> was blown to
atoms only a few days ahead, and our own escape was
pure luck. There was considerable alarm on board,
and I was once more filled with gratitude for my own
small share of the fatalism of the Turk!</p>

<p class='c012'>On this occasion, for my own private benefit, I
could also have wished that our captain had been a
“smaller” man, or one less scrupulously compact of
duty. When I admitted that I had really come on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>board in search of a British flag, no matter how torn
and tattered, he only looked at me as though I were
mad.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You don’t seem to know much about the inner
workings of the navy,” was all he <i>said</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“One does not bother about the ‘inner workings’
of anything one loves,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>So with the gravest courtesy he explained to me
that a new flag could not possibly be obtained until the
“tattered” one had been handed over to H.Q. Nevertheless
I believe that a French, Italian, or even an
American, captain would have contrived some means of
acceding to my request.</p>

<p class='c012'>As it happens, I once saw the man off his guard. He
was playing the host to a beautiful Englishwoman and
her French husband, his neighbours on their own yacht,
and no one could have seemed more naturally genial
and light-hearted, with his really delightful sense of
humour. Is it <i>necessary</i> for a uniform to conceal all
traces of humanity? Why could not the world see
the man’s best side in the officer? The strictest sense
of “fair play,” combined with great patience, will
work even better with the Turks when added to a
generous supply of smiles and wit.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>When the Vali sent word that all was ready for me
to proceed on my way to Angora, I could not hesitate.
Whatever my compatriots may have said, and would,
no doubt, have now repeated with greater emphasis,
I could not think of having allowed him to take so
much trouble on my account for nothing!</p>

<p class='c012'>Above all, particularly towards a Moslem, the last
thing that any lady could think of doing would be to
betray the slightest lack of trust. What matter if we
were on the brink of war? It simply never entered
my head that I could really come to any harm from
the Turks!</p>

<p class='c012'>It is of interest, nevertheless, to put on record the
various, not altogether unreasonable, warnings that
I received at the hotel in Smyrna from my fellow-guests.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>One and all were quite convinced that I had taken leave
of my senses. Only a mad woman would think of
going to Angora at this season and on the brink of
war!</p>

<p class='c012'><i>The Spaniard</i> had spent his life in the Near East
and knew the Turks! “Your own friends,” he said,
“the Ministers who know you, may show you the
greatest respect; but you are English and cannot
speak the language. The <i>people</i> are mere fanatics!”
However, he gave me a box of insect powder, a bottle
of iodine, and—most welcome of all to me—a yard of
flannel to make an abdominal belt!</p>

<p class='c012'><i>One Italian</i> implored me to “come back and enjoy
the Italian skies.... You will freeze in Angora.”
He gave me a packet of chocolate and half a bottle of
cognac.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>A Second Italian</i> could only endeavour to “face
the fact” that I was determined to have my way. As
he knew something of where I was going, he brought me
quinine, asperin, mosquito-cream, and calomel.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>The Dane</i> was horrified to learn that I had no gold.
“Gold is essential in war-time. Gold saved my life
in Russia;” and he handed me in exchange for paper
fifty gold Turkish pounds, which, however, proved more
weighty than useful.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>The Dutch Parson</i> gave me his blessing. Though
generally optimistic and pro-Turk, he admitted that
things looked unusually black at the moment, and
advised me to “wait and see.”</p>

<p class='c012'><i>A British Naval Officer</i> would not admit the sarcasm
of his comment that it was “very interesting” of me
to “go to Angora!” He considered “the Turks
the finest race on the face of the earth.... My God,
they know what I mean!” And, personally, I believe
they knew very well.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>One American</i> could only repeat that “it was a mad
idea.... We are not safe even here. There is
plenty of oil there, certainly, but—heroics <i>is</i> heroics!”</p>

<p class='c012'><i>A Second American</i> wanted to know “what they
were giving me for this stunt,” and guessed “it was a
pretty high figure.” That I was going on my own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>responsibility and paying my own way he “simply
would not believe.”</p>

<p class='c012'><i>The South American</i> was the first of them all to
express any confidence that the Turks would be kind.
What <i>he</i> dreaded for me was the discomfort. “Above
all,” he said, “avoid the Red Army.”</p>

<p class='c012'><i>The Englishman</i> characteristically pinned his faith on
the courage of our race. “It has brought you here,”
said he, “and I believe it will bring you back.... Here
is my woollen jacket, a tin of milk, and this
letter to an American friend of mine. Promise me, if
<i>ever</i> you are in difficulty, you will seek his help.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I afterwards made inquiries about this invaluable
ally, though I was, fortunately, in no danger. I found
that, after all, he never reached Angora, though he
had applied to go there last March!</p>

<p class='c012'><i>A Third Italian</i> told me that he had just found a
little silver St. Antoine de Padou among the ruins.... “My
prayers for you will go with it always. After the
snows of Angora, our Italian sunshine, its songs and
its laughter, will await you.” Besides the St. Anthony,
he gave me a book of Italian proverbs, a box of insect-powder,
cough-drops, and chocolate.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>The Frenchman</i> only exclaimed: “No Angora for
me, <i>merci</i>! I am counting the hours until the boat
arrives to take me away from all this.”</p>

<p class='c012'><i>The Englishwoman</i> (Mrs. de C——) felt proud to
think of the “feather in a woman’s cap,” that such an
adventure would surely prove.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>The Dutchman</i> declared that he would trust even
his own daughter on such a journey, if “the Vali had
pledged his word for her safe conduct.... I know this
country inside out—its language, its dangers, its
possibilities, its virtues and faults.... You may trust
the Vali.... If war breaks out, they will take you,
with all possible politeness, to the nearest frontier.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He gave me all kinds of useful information, and
much-needed boxes of matches and cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Truly a wonderful budget of advice and a most
original collection of gifts! Did ever a woman thus
start such a quest?</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Yet they had made me sad! Some were born here,
others had lived in the country all their lives, and how
few of them would trust the Turk, to whom, after all,
they owed, at least, their material existence.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will show you,” I said, as we were all assembled
for farewell, “that I am right, and you are <i>all</i> wrong.
Though my country may turn on Turkey, she will be
good to me.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>It was nearly seven o’clock next morning before
the officer came for me. It was so late that our horses
had to be whipped up to a smart pace over the bumpy
road to the station. My conductor had been so anxious
about all arrangements, that he had packed the food
for our five or seven days’ trip, and entrusted it to a
chauffeur, who was perverse enough not to wake up
in time.</p>

<p class='c012'>This certainly might be regarded as an omen of ill-luck,
and even as I got into the train, between the
officer and a cheik (who had been professor of Arabic
at Oxford), the South American stepped forward to
ask whether, after all, I had not better return with
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And show the Turks I do not trust them.... Never.
Besides, this gentleman has lived in Oxford,
and is therefore almost a compatriot. Tell my friends
in Smyrna that I am perfectly well and happy, and
that I am going to have a lovely time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I saw that both my conductors were greatly pleased
by my expressions of trust, which they well knew how
to appreciate.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, when we had been driving along the
quay and my eyes had fallen on our own man-of-war
flying the Union Jack without which, for the first
time in my life, I was embarking upon my perilous
way, I was not far from tears.</p>

<p class='c012'>My thoughts were crowded with all that England
has ever meant to me, from the quiet corner in the
churchyard where my father is sleeping, to the little
face, seldom innocent of jam, that looks up so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>eagerly to tell his “Auntie” he has been a naughty
boy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Shall I, indeed, soon find myself in an “enemy”
country, which surely should be, as I have always
known it, the land of my England’s dearest friends?</p>

    <div>EMOTIONS AND IMPRESSIONS—“ON THE WAY.”—NOWHERE TO HOUSE THE POOR PEOPLE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>It</span> was, indeed, a kindly Providence that led the
cheik to accompany us upon this stage of my tour.
No one could have been more polite and thoughtful,
more ready to gratify my every wish at great personal
sacrifice, than the officer from Smyrna. But he had
not been at Oxford; he could not speak our language
with the distinguished accent of that University;
above all, he had not the vast culture of this man of
God. His information would have been conveyed in
German, a language I speak with <i>no</i> pleasure.</p>
<p class='c012'>The cheik has large brown eyes, a dusky skin,
and a face which, though stamped with suffering, is
kindness itself. He wore a long grey coat and turban,
and appeared to me at that moment years older than
his actual age. Maybe my inborn veneration for
Oxford professors misled me; and no doubt I was also
influenced by the obvious respect of the many hoary-headed
disciples who came to the station to bid their
“Master” farewell, bending to kiss his hand and
receive his blessing. Great erudition, again, must
always add to a man’s appearance of age, and his
allusions to varied experiences in many a Moslem land
did certainly suggest the passing of years.</p>

<p class='c012'>Like myself, however, he was going to Angora for
the first time, venturing behind the long line of
bayonets which still separates that troubled land from
the rest of the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>In complete sympathy with my admiration for
these men who had suffered and been victorious, he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>eager to learn a little of the tribulation through which
they had fought their way to liberty and freedom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It seems to me,” I began, “that were I the British
High Commissioner, I should have found some means
of, at least, paying a visit to Angora. What do our
legislators yet know about this land under their charge,
for which they have been made responsible? They
can have no idea of the people’s aims, their faults and
their virtues. You might as well take charge of some
province in heaven of which you only know that it
exists.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is not a Turk to-day who would not welcome
you as British High Commissioner,” was the
gallant reply. “We are, indeed, deeply grateful for
your trust. You have found the key to unlock Moslem
hearts—to <i>trust</i> us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Surely it is with nations as with individuals, the
man who trusts and is deceived will yet prevail over
his deceiver, whatever temporary profits that traitor
may grasp. There can be no final conquest over
truth. That was my late father’s teaching, and if
it has sometimes left me an easy prey to liars and
thieves, it has not killed my faith in human nature or
hurt my pride. Self-respect will always compel me
to treat every man as my friend.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As we proceeded on our journey, one felt hourly
more conscious of the barrier that has been so
unwisely set up between the Allies and Angora. As
railway and telegraphic communications had been cut
off, news was not only delayed, but distorted beyond
recognition. One only marvels that some grave
disaster has not arisen from such confused reports,
apparent contradictions, stern threats, and frequent
misunderstandings. It would seem as if the Allied
Commissioners had no desire to keep in touch with this
“little Republic of the Mountains.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In all my wanderings I have never experienced
such an overpowering sense of isolation. For me there
have been no “personal” communications from Europe
since October. That “English letters are not accepted
in Anatolia,” that all my friends’ news will be returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to them marked “Service suspended” or “cannot be
reached,” may explain the facts but does not make
them easier to bear. When homeless dogs howl and
whine outside my bedroom window, superstitions will
intrude—dread of disaster to distant friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is, however, another and far more cheering
side to our experiences on the road. The “stranger
within the gates” is still a sacred person to these
peasants, even although from an “enemy” land. There
was absolutely no sign of hostility all along the line,
but everywhere the greatest kindness. One and all
gave me the gracious Eastern welcome, in picturesque
phrases, commending me to the care of Allah; these
“fanatics” from whom mere murder was the smallest
evil I had been told to expect!</p>

<p class='c012'>Though we had started, through no fault of our
own, without any provision for food, I did not anticipate
any serious inconvenience on this account. In
these hospitable countries I knew we had only to name
our need. The cheik, indeed, had been presented
with two large baskets of food by his disciples, and
also carried a picturesque terra-cotta water-pot, which
he could refill whenever we stopped to alight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eat, my children,” said he, “and when all is
finished, the Lord will provide.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a feast from the Song of Solomon,” I
exclaimed, as the contents of his basket were disclosed—pomegranates,
spices, nuts, helva (i.e., honey
and nut-cheese), raisins, and bread!</p>

<p class='c012'>One is grateful for these slow trains that afford such
ample opportunity for seeing the country, with its
fig-trees, olives, and palms, and the bright sun bringing
a climate that recalls the South of France. Yet
everywhere, long before we reached the actual devastations,
one felt that despair and sadness were hovering
over the land. At first, we sought in vain for the reason
of our impressions. Then suddenly I knew: There
were no cattle.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, Mrs. de. C—— had told me, they had all
been brought into Smyrna by the Greeks. Outside her
house mules were being sold for fourpence or sixpence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>apiece, and if no purchaser could be found even at that
figure, the wretched creatures were left mutilated on
the wayside, their eyes burnt out, their legs broken
by hatchets!</p>

<p class='c012'>Our first halt was at Manissa, once a flourishing
town of about ninety thousand inhabitants, standing
some sixty-five kilometres above sea-level. The
Governor and all the “notables” were on the platform
to welcome the travellers, and had arranged
that the “train should wait,” for us to be shown
round.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some kind of most primitive carriage had been
produced from somewhere, and we were driven through
more “ruins” to the “temporary” town hall for
the inevitable coffee and cigarettes. In the best
English, the governor told us of Greek atrocities and
the victory of M. Kemal Pasha, introducing us also to
his whole staff.</p>

<p class='c012'>I asked whether it would be possible for me to
obtain precise figures of the devastations, and he
promised they should be prepared for my use at once.
When I reminded him of the “waiting” train, he
merely waived such difficulties aside as a “secondary
consideration,” begging me “not to mention it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Naturally, I found one ruined town very like another.
There was, in a sense, little to see beyond “parts of”
the mosques, badly scorched or half-burnt minarets,
and, at Manissa, no more than one thousand houses
standing out of fourteen! Also, the statistics reveal
a heartrending loss of life!</p>

<p class='c012'>The women and children, I learnt, had been
driven into the mosques, which were surrounded by
machine-guns to ensure against any possibility of
escape, and <i>then</i> set on fire. As the full realisation
of such hideous barbarity took hold of my imagination,
it was as if all my senses were paralysed. That
cold perspiration which so often precedes a faint,
seized my limbs. I was powerless either to speak or
move. How would our twentieth century appear to
the old cave-dwellers it has pleased us to call savage?
Mrs. de C—— was right, indeed, to say that the Turks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>were “moderate.” Such scenes must compel revenge
and let loose the worst passions of men.</p>

<p class='c012'>On our return the cheik tactfully endeavoured to
distract our thoughts by hospitable preparations for
lunch. However little one felt disposed to eat, he
could have devised no kinder or more wise expression
of sympathy and understanding. Unfortunately, we
had not yet escaped the company of swarming flies,
which afterwards vanished, however, with startling
completeness, when the train climbed into colder
altitudes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our next halt was at Kassaba, where the “notables”
again paid us a visit, offering <i>both</i> coffee and tea, one
after the other. When the cheik mentioned the loss
of our food, <i>and</i> my partiality for fruit, a messenger was
at once sent into the town for bread and the most
luscious melons, which reach to the highest possible
perfection in Anatolia. I have always been grateful
for Turkish fruit!</p>

<p class='c012'>The Governor told me “he had simply <i>nowhere</i> to
house the poor people.” He “dare not think” of
how they could pass the winter! I <i>saw</i> them, sitting
in holes among the ruins, cooking whatever they had
been able to scrape together for a meal; the women
huddled together in the “beds” of fountains which
were covered with straw and carpets, after the water
had been drained out. This arrangement permitted
the slight protection of an awning, only too badly
needed for their threadbare clothes!</p>

<p class='c012'>There seems no way of coping with the emergency,
since they had no tools for even the most primitive
building. Except for those lucky enough to secure one
of the few booths in the town, the shopkeepers had to
set out their stock upon the cobblestones!</p>

<p class='c012'>I dare not ask how many babies had died of cold.
Anatolia has been bled white through twelve years of
war! Whatever the nation’s quarrel, it was from
hence were taken father, or brother, or son. Yet still,
beside these shivering women, you see long train-loads
of more soldiers, cattle-trucks full of human beings,
called to some new “front.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>How is it these women can, even now, tenderly hush
“the cry of the children,” and give their men? Theirs
is a “willing” sacrifice for an ideal, the freedom and
independence of the Fatherland.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I had been “protected” in advance, I found, by
the authorities, who had announced by telegram the
arrival of “an American lady.” It was, perhaps,
perverse, even ungrateful, but I persisted in contradicting
the news at every stage. I would far sooner
take all risks under my own flag than falsely accept
shelter beneath the “Stars and Stripes.” “I have no
dislike for America,” I assured those who assumed that
explanation of my obstinacy, “it simply does not
happen to be my country, any more than India is
yours.... I have nothing but good to say of individual
Americans; the most charming people on the
face of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless “I keenly resent the clamour of
Mr. Morgenthau for ‘an ideal republic of his own
making on the banks of the Bosphorus, to be backed
by all that “Tammany” means in the U.S.A.’ I am
for asking him, then, to start by making an ‘ideal’
republic on the banks of the Hudson.”</p>

<p class='c012'>American oil-hunters are always boasting that <i>they</i>
never declared war on Turkey. “You did not,” I
have admitted, “but you urged, nay begged and
almost ordered, us to do it for you.... Your <i>Literary
Digest</i> printed at least one eloquent appeal to Great
Britain for a ‘holy’ war against the ‘unspeakable
Turk’!” And if they resent my protest at being
called “an American,” I am convinced they would
have done the same in my place. They, too, have the
virtue of national pride.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The train was held up once more for a little excursion
to what had been the prosperous town of
Alaşehir, a well-wooded district with abundance of
fresh water. Here out of four thousand eight hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>houses only one hundred remain, and the women and
children have been simply wiped out! Unfortunately,
we had not time to visit the Hodja, who had found a
quite comfortable lodging in the trunk of an oak tree—a
philosopher and a man of letters. “I cannot live
in a tub, like Diogenes, because I do not possess a tub;
but there is nothing wrong with this oak, which
I suspect will prove even warmer.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Everywhere, at Manissa and Kassaba—even at
Salihli, with its houses reduced to four!—we were
invited to stay and “put up for the night!” Here
were about two hundred inhabitants surviving from
two thousand five hundred, and from fifteen to twenty
families sleeping in the mosque. Yet, they would
“certainly arrange something,” and it needed all my
tact to refuse any more extended hospitality than tea
and coffee, served on the roof of one of their four houses,
from which we could look down upon the skeleton
town. Apparently, these stricken people found some
sort of comfort in the mere idea of my having <i>seen</i>
their suffering, though often enough I could not even
find <i>words</i> for the sympathy no one could fail to feel.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once more lunch in the train. Pomegranate seeds
should be eaten one by one, a slow process, but as the
cheik says “it passes the hours!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He apologised for the number of times I had been
reminded of what in Turkey they call “the work of
the British ex-Premier.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I had to expect that,” I replied, “when I came
to Anatolia; and it gives me the chance of reminding
the Turks what part was played by M. Venizelos!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He tactfully turned the conversation to Oxford,
paying a very high tribute to Mr. Asquith’s brilliant
son: “A noble character, highly intelligent and broad-minded.
A victim of war we could ill afford to lose!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Association inevitably led to the question I must
have been asked a hundred times during my journey,
“Why does Lloyd George hate us so bitterly? How
can he admire the Greeks?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“He knows little of either,” I replied, “nothing, at
any rate, from personal observation of them in their
own lands. We have first-class Near-East specialists,
no doubt; but his chief informants have been nonconformist
preachers, even more biassed than he.
Nonconformity is the traditional foe of the Turks.
Their boasted ‘freedom of thought and conscience’
does not extend to the Servants of the Prophet,
and as they once echoed Gladstone, to-day they echo
Lloyd George.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And in America?” asked the cheik.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Their church is an advertising agency. They
have transformed ‘dissent’ to a ‘trust.’ Go to the
States with an idea, and, if it pleases them, they will
‘put it across’ like any other commodity, as a ‘cute’
business proposition. With a colony of two million
Greeks, and, maybe, as many Armenians (whose
exaggerated and unchecked ‘lamentations’ have full
Free-Church support), America will never give Turkey
even a fair hearing. You have read their ‘Press’?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alas,” he answered, “I fear the East is losing
its faith in the West.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do not say that,” I answered. “Men like you,
who have known us at our best, must declare that
to-day’s madness is but a phase. Tell us these things
should never have been and shall not continue. Write
as you <i>can</i> write, and teach the people of Europe to be
once more themselves.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When East and West shake hands again, there
will be peace, and peace we <i>must have!</i>”</p>

    <div>MORE IMPRESSIONS—“SITTING AMIDST AN ARMY OF SUPPOSED SAVAGE FANATICS, DEBATING THE GREATNESS OF GOD”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> train is slowly crawling up the heights, the air
grows colder and colder, we put on wrap after wrap,
and, all of a sudden, not a fly to be seen!</p>
<p class='c012'>The scenery, meanwhile, seems more desolate at
every mile we pass. The horribly systematic destruction
has overlooked nothing, and every village is in
ruins. The corn, so carefully hidden in pits, has been
burned; the water, on which life itself depends,
has been polluted; the peasants are vainly digging in
search of the hard-earned paper money, savings which
they had buried beneath the soil, only to turn up a
few black cinders! Even the trees have been nearly all
razed to the ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is nothing you can tell me about the “devastated
areas” in France, for I have visited every inch
of the ground; but there the people could move on
to the next villages, and were not imprisoned among the
ruins. I would not minimise German atrocities, but
they did not fill the churches with women and children
before firing them! The wholesale destruction of
villages and of cattle is not “legitimate warfare,”
but this butchering of women has put the Greek outside
the pale of civilisation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They have left us the sunset,” I could only
murmur, “this marvellous panorama of which one
never tires.” The desolation, indeed, lends it a double
wonder. Why cannot men, too, die in glory?</p>

<p class='c012'>The railway line has been cut at Gunhani. Here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>no doubt, the Governor has been instructed not only
to welcome us with every comfort—tea, coffee, and
statistics—but to find us beds which do not exist!</p>

<p class='c012'>We are travelling in the dark, since the sun has
deserted us. Every now and again the officer flashes
out his little electric lamp to see that all is well. The
feelings of my fellow-passengers must be murderous,
for have I not kept the train waiting all along the line,
so that we are even later than normal Turkish management
would have made us? But I can detect no
black looks.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the pitchy darkness, as the train slows down for
the last time, before its immediate “return” journey,
ragged figures are seen crowding the station. Their
turbans are brightly coloured, despite the dirt and rain
to which they have been exposed; their clothes are
mere “shreds and patches”; they have fashioned
themselves picturesque slippers of straw. Like the
grotesque figures of some stage chorus from no man’s
land, they dart about us on every side, each man seizing
upon some one article of luggage. If I express anxiety
about my possessions, the cheik bids me “fear not.
God is with us. All is well, and in a short while we
shall remember this discomfort but as a page of history.”
It was a lesson against worry I never forgot—the
secret of Islam’s suffering in silence!</p>

<p class='c012'>Stumbling over a stony and dangerous roadway,
we at last reach a tent on the side of the mountains,
which has been prepared for us by the reserve officers.
We must sit on the cheik’s trunks and prayer-carpets,
for the ground is damp and mists enfold us. My chivalrous
friend insists on wrapping about me his shawl,
his scarf, finally his long coat. “I do not feel the cold
as you do,” he declares as I try to protest; but the
touch of his hand contradicts the kind words.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the distance we could see a few hill-fires and
the torches of night-wanderers as we enjoyed our
evening meal. But no sooner had I begun to wonder
how many hours must pass before our experience
became history, than, behold, a gust of wind tore up
the prop of our tent and buried us in confused <i>débris</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>There was nothing for it but to extract ourselves
and sit <i>upon</i> instead of <i>beneath</i> the shelter that had been
found for us. The cheik bravely proceeded to delight
me with all the wisdom of his religious philosophy
while the officer went in search of help. I have done
strange things in strange lands, but I wonder what
would British “authority” say to this? An unarmed,
but fearless, Englishwoman in the damp, cold mists,
waiting through the dark night for her “discomfort to
become history,” amidst an army of supposed savage
fanatics, and debating the greatness of God! Truly,
the Unknown bears strange offspring.</p>

<p class='c012'>Little darts of light, no bigger than glowworms,
are now everywhere moving up and down the steep
paths through the black mist.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not easy for the swiftest of native messengers
to track the “hidden” official of the mountains. Yet
they seem to slip over the dark ways like birds, carrying
their message and returning while you are wondering if
they have yet started upon the road. Men have been
despatched, like carrier-pigeons, in all directions, and
we soon hear that the commandant, two hours away,
has set out to find us, and we are to walk as far as we
can to meet him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once more the long procession, carrying its shawls
and cushions, bags and water-pots, is marching in
hope of a night’s repose. In a little, however, from
somewhere, “orders” come in to “halt, and prepare
the lady a bed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Behold, it is done. Two boxes are found to support a
wooden plank, <i>beneath</i> which the cheik will find some
measure of rest for his weary limbs, though he has
given me his prayer-mat for mattress, his attaché-case
for a pillow and, against my express command,
nearly all the wraps in his possession. Under such
conditions one does not “undress” for the night;
but rather contrives every possible addition to the
number of thick woollen garments normally required
in these climes. The officer has not even a rug to
protect him from the damp earth, and I find words
strong enough to resist the loan of his coat.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Alas! I am not, after all, a true Eastern. My
philosophy will not bring sleep. Never since the days
when the awful stream of gassed men were being carried
into the hospital, have I listened to such a terrible
chorus of coughs. There is little enough “quiet in
sleep” on these saturated clay mounds, although I
no longer hear the Nationalist Anthem and other
patriotic strains, to the accompaniment of a piping flute,
which had been rising about me in the evening air.</p>

<p class='c012'>Probably the cold that seemed almost beyond
endurance, did not really master me for long, as all
these numbing horrors were lost in unconsciousness
before the dawn.</p>

<p class='c012'>I am awakened at last by the officer who ventures
to “shake the sleeper,” being seriously alarmed, he
tells me, by my pale looks. There is a most welcome
glass of hot tea, and a fire! A mingling of German
and Turkish assail my ears, while from the distance
I hear a silver voice calling the “faithful” to prayer.
Here is a free translation from the cheik, of the
muezzin’s words: “Get up, you lazy fellows, rise,
make your ablutions, and praise God for His goodness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I can only repeat “praise God,” though in face of
what we have seen even these words seem almost
mockery.</p>

<p class='c012'>“God is great,” said the holy man, “but man will
not understand His greatness. God loves the East,
whence came thought, philosophy, and faith. The
Christ we, too, venerate, came from the East. Yet
the West has given us nought but injustice. You
who love the East, pray for tolerance and understanding
between all peoples.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The muezzin has awakened all the soldiers in the
mountains. One could fancy a scurry of rabbits from
the hidden tents. They are fetching water for the
ablutions, and I, too, must wash me—in eau de Cologne.
The blood flowing into my numbed limbs forces a cry
I cannot stifle. “That is what happens when a
woman goes out to war,” I said with a laugh, for the
officer confessed that I had given him some anxious
moments.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Yet another cup of tea outside the now stifling tent,
over the exquisite violet-tinted fumes of a charcoal
fire—deadly poison, maybe, but harmless so long as you
do not <i>know</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ablutions, a religious rite, are performed here
in couples—one pouring the water into the other’s
hands, that he may wash his face three times, carefully
going over the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. When he,
in his turn, pours the water for his companion.</p>

<p class='c012'>The cheik tells me Moslem custom demands the
body <i>must</i> be clean, though the clothes may not
be free from dirt. If only the morning “ablutions”
were part of our Christian creed, what a difference
they would make to the comfort, <i>par exemple</i>, of
Naples!</p>

<p class='c012'>All now lay down their “carpets,” and proceed to
prayer. To-day, indeed, many must manage with the
bare earth. What an inspiring picture it is—the
absolutely unselfconscious absorption of the humble
and prostrate Turk before his God! There is, surely, a
sense of shame to the true Christian for some of his own
brethren in the sight of reverence so natural and so
devout.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>My enthusiasm, unfortunately, does not extend to
the steaming dish of most sustaining breakfast-soup,
compounded of flour and vinegar and egg. One or two
sips of the tonic are enough a send me to dry bread
and a glass of tea—about my tenth since dawn!</p>

<p class='c012'>All around us, though not yet in their uniforms,
are scattered the future soldiers of the new Citizen
State, ready and eager, poor fellows, for their fifty
miles march a day, on coffee and bread, or even on
bread and water!</p>

<p class='c012'>By what right do we ask such things from the
sons of women? That, cut off from every pleasure,
all joy in God’s world, they should spend their days in
war and prayer! They seem happier, somehow,
than those of us who have travelled and seen the world,
who must think and judge for ourselves, wondering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>at last what is Truth or Justice, where are the profits of
self-sacrifice? Love and joy are, after all, but the
“negatives” of grief and hate. Abolish the dark
couple, and you will gain the light.</p>

<p class='c012'>For the moment, however, the soldiers of to-morrow
are content. They have never tasted alcohol; miserably
clad, without proper clothing or shelter, they sit
about us expressionless and resigned—singing hymns
of joy that sound far more like a funeral dirge. There
is no need for thought, since they are ready to die
for their fatherland, their leader, their faith.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet, though they know I come from an “enemy”
country, there is no kindness and consideration they
will not extend to a woman who trusts them. Where is
the Bolshevism of those who have lifted me over every
step of mud, and are even now girding their loins to
carry me onwards for forty miles? Will <i>they</i> massacre,
who, at my bidding, would lay them down for me to
walk over were I to make such an idle request?
Fear belongs to those <i>responsible</i> for England’s injustice.
They, indeed, among these people, <i>would</i> be torn
limb from limb and trampled on unto death.</p>

<p class='c012'>We have no horses or anything on four legs to
draw the loaded wagonette, that must now carry the
cheik and myself, in addition to its usual cargo of
food and varied wrappings. I have, certainly, had
“smarter” escorts than the men now drawing our
“equipage,” but never any with kinder hearts.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is no thought here of payment for service.
Money is firmly refused; and from those who have,
and seek, absolutely nothing for themselves, such a
welcome could not fail to touch the most callous of
human beings. How is it that all Europe declares
no one can “manage” these simple folk? My own
receipt for life with the Moslem—of mere courteous
consideration and unquestioning trust—has been repaid
with compound interest a thousand times!</p>

    <div>A JOURNEY ON FOOT—A COUNTRY MADE BY GOD, UNTOUCHED BY MAN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>It</span> is not given to many in this enlightened twentieth
century to travel in a country as God made it, almost
untouched by man. Upon the road from Gunhani
I saw no signs of man’s handiwork, save a few miles of
Deacoville, a tunnel, and the primitive carts of Anatolia.
These are made from a few logs nailed together, and
fastened to two wheels, cut solidly out of a block of
wood. Their continuous squeak does not seem out of
keeping with the primitive surroundings, and may be regarded
as an “accompaniment” to the peasant’s songs.</p>
<p class='c012'>The story is told of a “benevolent” American
whose imagination was fired by the project of turning
this land into a “new America.” He would subject
the fertile soil to “intensive” cultivation and smother
it with sky-scrapers. So he persuaded a Turk to come
over to “God’s own country” (as man has made it)
and study the United States.</p>

<p class='c012'>His guest, however, refused to admire, took passage
for home at the earliest possible opportunity, and
informed his friends that, “having now seen man’s
‘best’ country, he would never again leave God’s.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, in the Western mind these wide
stretches of waste land among the beautiful mountains,
beneath a cloudless sky, cannot fail to rouse a
longing to break the silence by a “little emptying of
our crowded towns.” The women and old men <i>are</i>
digging, sowing, and cultivating, with but slight return
for their heavy labour; now that the young are all
“wanted” for defence.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“One day we <i>shall</i> have peace,” said I to our carriers,
and they murmured “<i>Inch Allah!</i>” Turning my wish
to prayer, I could only repeat, “We <i>shall</i> have peace.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As often as I can persuade them to rest, I seize the
chance of telling them about England. When I
mention our great Moslem King George they naturally
confuse him with Lloyd George. And, later, “if your
King loves his Moslem subjects, as you say he does,
why does he permit his Minister to remain?” I assure
them that he will not, and their faces brighten as
they cry: “There will be peace, then.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As we plunge into the tunnel, about a kilometre
long, our men raise strange howls which echo around
us with the most weird effect; but we are in darkness
that can be felt, and anyone coming unwarned in an
opposite direction, which is <i>downhill</i>, could scarcely
avoid a crash. As it happens, there is an engineer on
the line. Our men lift off his wagonette and replace
it, further down, than ours.</p>

<p class='c012'>I marvelled that they had sufficient strength for
the job, living on coffee and bread. Meanwhile, our
flashlight revealed Turkish ladies walking along the
tunnel without a glimmer of light to guide them, who
made their way by a continuous beating of sticks upon
the wall.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this strange land, one is not afraid! I think of
all the alarm my journey excited in Smyrna, and am
more than ever convinced that I <i>only</i> need an interpreter.
If I knew the language, I would go alone and
without fear! Primitive people in Turkey have a
high code of honour. They would not steal a penny,
they will not even accept what I offer to pay. Though
he would tear to pieces an enemy of his country, the
Turk would stand between me and danger, for he
knows I am a friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>At last we are out of the tunnel, stretching our legs
with relief in the open air. Suddenly a strange sound
breaks on our ears from the mountains. As we stop to
listen, we hear someone calling upon us to “Halt!
You must go no further!” I remember—this day,
they had told me, there would be “war”! A strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>figure seems to be hopping down the mountains, about
800 metres in height, which proves to be the <i>Commandant
de la Place</i>. He had arrived at our tent very late
the night before, and left me a “message of welcome.”
Is he now bringing the terrible news the war has
begun? No. Only offering us hospitality.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had not expected us to start so early, and
apologised for “calling in his nightgown”—the only
alternative to letting us pass his “inhospitable doors.”
I begged that I might take a photograph, and, leaving
all our belongings upon the wayside, we readily set out
to climb the mountain, while he shouted the news of
our approach to hasten the preparations of his wife.
As a matter of fact, the difficulties of the ascent were
quite sufficient to give her ample time; and when we
reached the house at last, the pure, fresh air (that
struck cold in spite of the brilliant sunshine) inspired
a hearty welcome to “rest” after so stiff a climb!</p>

<p class='c012'>The commandant (who is richly bronzed by outdoor
life in the sun) seemed quite content with his two-roomed
cabin among the hills, though one could sense
the tragic experiences he would never obtrude. Three
of his children had perished from cold and hardship, and
I caught anxious glances towards the two remaining,
fine, sturdy-looking little creatures as they were. His
mother-in-law, busily intent on grinding the corn,
bore further witness to their hidden struggles.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was immediately given a chair; a mattress was
found for the cheik, and once more we learned that in
this country you are expected to have some coffee
<i>before</i> a glass of tea, and then roasted almonds and
melon-seeds. I like to think it was the children who
decorated their little cat’s ears with pink tassels in our
honour, much to the animal’s annoyance. While the
pig had been also “decorated,” to <i>his</i> intense delight!</p>

<p class='c012'>Madame retired immediately on our arrival; but
when “tea” was finished, I begged that she might
join us. Though veiled and shy, she came. Then she
and her husband brought their outes (a Turkish guitar
played with a feather) and sang to us without any
restraint.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>We stayed with them so many hours that, at last,
I began to fear I was expected to make the first move.
At three o’clock I asked the cheik when we were going
to continue our journey, and he quickly answered:
“When you please”—confirming my suspicions.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was now informed that we should probably be
too late for the one train in the day, and have to face
a journey of many hours in bullock-wagons, drawn perhaps
by mules. No one even hinted that I was to blame;
yet no one would have dreamt of being so rude as to
tell me that it was <i>my</i> place to break up the party!</p>

<p class='c012'>The line from Smyrna to Angora had been cut
at Gunhani, as had the line from Haïdar Pasha at
Bilidjik and Kara-Keuy.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Gunhani we had to reach Afioun-Karahissar as
we best could, partly by Deacoville, then by ox-wagon
and luggage trains to Ouchak and on to Afioun. The
railway bridge destroyed at Gunhani was a fine example
of French engineering, which went right over the
mountains, from eight hundred to a thousand feet
high. It will take years to rebuild. The Turks do not
complain, and have cheerfully accepted the terrible
discomfort to passengers and goods traffic, with their
usual philosophy. “The destruction of an important
railway,” as they calmly remark, “is legitimate warfare
and first-class strategy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We could realise, however, what the disaster really
<i>meant</i>, as we climbed down, without the help
of any kind of pathway, from the commandant’s little
house on the steep hills. Once on the road we took an
ox-wagon, drawn by mules, for what was still little
better than a mountain track, to the nearest point of
the railway that was in order, in the direction of Afioun-Karahissar.
Unable, like the cheik or any Oriental, to
sit on my legs, I had to let them hang over the side
of our wagon.</p>

<p class='c012'>This scurrying down from the commandant’s house
was not “a picnic!” Our fearless drivers and their
marvellously sure-footed beasts, could not prevent our
being flung from side to side of the springless cart,
holding on for dear life. Sometimes the officer had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>to spring out and push from behind to save us from
falling backwards.</p>

<p class='c012'>The telegraph wires, of course, were also cut;
but the rapidity with which messengers are able to run
and leap over these ragged mountain ways enabled them
to bring news <i>back</i> to us, of the quickest way to find a
train, in an incredibly short time.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>In an Ox Wagon.</span><br />“Unable to sit on my legs, I have to let them hang over the side of our wagon.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>I had found it a herculean task to reach, and
return, from our resting place on the hill-top. The
bullock-cart seemed to find it scarcely <i>less</i> difficult to
manipulate the narrow and broken roadway. Yet the
Turkish soldiers had <i>somehow</i> found means and strength
to heave their heavy artillery over these awe-inspiring
passes, from which one slip of the foot meant instant
death.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was, naturally, “nothing doing” at the
station till very late that night, when we should have
to pass the dark hours in a luggage train. Just before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>it was due to start, however, the Governor arrived with
sardines, fruit, and bread, of which we managed to make
a good dinner “on board,” actually our first meal
that day, except for the commandant’s almonds.</p>

<p class='c012'>A chair was found for me in the empty carriage, but
others had to sit on the floor. We had candles and,
by some means, word was sent in advance of our
approach. They tell me it is quite a short journey,
but I cannot help wishing that we had been able to
stay in the bullock-carts.</p>

<p class='c012'>Through that strange night—not so cold, indeed, as
yesterday—we seemed to crawl on one mile and then
shunt back two, to an awful accompaniment of clanging
metal that made it impossible to sleep. I had only
to close my eyes for a moment and our train was
certain to be violently thrown back. Really, I thought
my head would be shaken off my body.</p>

<p class='c012'>As always, the cheik made heroic efforts to wile
away the dark hours and distract my mind. There was
no question I could ask him about Islam in vain. Here
is the best I can reproduce of that fascinating lesson
in faith and philosophy delivered in a luggage train
by night:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The very word <i>Obedience</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Islam) is contrary to
all Bolshevist ideas, just as Bolshevism itself is contradicted
by the Reign of Terror in Russia. Islam teaches
the ‘preservation of property,’ Bolshevism destroys it.
Verily, the Turks must have passed through sorrow
and tribulation before they could ever have felt any
temptation to ally themselves with the Russia of
to-day. Yet the Soviet has helped us in our time of
need, and we owe our fidelity to the alliance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I spoke of the vast sums paid out by Russia to
Abdul Hamid to maintain enmity between the Turks
and Great Britain.... “That you have made friends
with your hereditary enemy surely means grave peril
to India.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So we all feel,” answered the cheik. “But we
can never forget the shock to the Moslem world of
the ‘rumour’ that Constantinople (the seat of Caliphat)
would be handed over to Russia. England had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>gone back on her word and lost our respect for ever.
Henceforth we could be deceived no longer. We were
cyphers, mere pawns, on the political chess-board of
the Powers. The principles of Islam were distorted
without hesitation to prove that no Christian peoples
could live unmolested under Turkish rule. How could
Great Britain be so blind to the unbounded respect she
had earned from Islam by her fine tolerance of <i>all</i>
religions in India? Now she has ‘changed all that,’ and
the war in the Near East was a <i>religious</i> war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When I attempted to frame some excuses for the
pro-Greek attitude of the British Government, he
reminded me of our “old pride in Moslem allegiance.
You have more Moslem than Christian subjects....
Is not your Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd George, a democrat?
Where can he find more perfect democracies
than in the East, under Moslem rule? It is a ‘new’
ideal in the West. When President Wilson began to
preach it, he was derided as a Utopian, because he was
three centuries ahead of his time! Every Moslem
has <i>always</i> been equal before the law—the Sultan stands
<i>with</i> his subjects.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That does not quite ‘explain’ Abdul Hamid,” I
said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He was the exception we shall never repeat.
You cannot argue from exceptions.... It is the
English who have ceased to value the precepts of Islam.
The Koran bids us obey those in authority. Rather
than rebel, we leave the country.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And M. Kemal Pasha? Has he not rebelled?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, indeed. He simply defended his country,
deposed the vassal-traitor-Sultan.... M. Kemal
Pasha rules direct from the Koran. He will have
strength to set aside the heresies of the Byzantines
that have been grafted on to our Government. It is
nonsense to say that the Koran has been found unfitted
for the requirements of the twentieth century.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There, I fear, I must plead guilty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will see, when you have stayed among us a
little longer, that it can be honestly interpreted to meet
man’s present needs.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“The freedom of women——?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The ‘seclusion’ comes from Byzantium. M.
Kemal will change that, if only he does not himself
make a foolish marriage.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do you mean—foolish?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A princess. We attribute Enver’s downfall to
his having married a princess. He then required
money to maintain his ‘royal’ position; we do
not inquire from whence it came! If M. Kemal
Pasha follows his example we shall lose faith in his
democracy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And a foreigner?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is almost as bad. The helpmeet of <i>our</i>
choice for him should be one who would help the
country to progress along Eastern lines, not Western.
Rather a peasant than a foreigner or a princess.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hope he may find one with the intelligence of
Halidé Hanoum, and with her womanly charm. To me
she seems wholly delightful. She can advance, and
remain a woman, as our Anglo-Saxon reformers have
seldom done.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We shall see; but you must make no mistake.
You imagine that women ‘do not count’ in the East,
yet I assure you a foolish marriage for M. Kemal Pasha
would be a national disaster.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish you were not so much against British rule.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must face facts. You have been doing strange
things here for the last twenty-three years. We do
not object to you because you are rulers, but to the
way in which you now rule. In Islam all the faiths
co-operate. Israel has its place, and we venerate
Christ no less than our Prophet. It is the same in
England itself, yet the very men whom you receive
in your London drawing-rooms are spoken of in
Egypt and India as ‘natives.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Neither can I understand that.” I agreed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, <i>you</i> would not; but, if you really want to
know the truth, we are discouraged and hurt. How
can your Empire accept your ex-Premier’s pro-Greek
campaign after his <i>glorious</i> speeches in support of
democracy?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“The more I think about it,” said I, “the less I
understand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, the consequences for us are black. We
were so long content to pass our days in confidence
that all was well with British at the helm. Now we
are watching with anxious eyes; only we pray that
the ‘to-morrow’ which all good Moslems desire, may
yet come with M. Kemal Pasha. I have sons, who
must all be soldiers, since we no longer trust the West.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will they be educated in England, at Oxford?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, alas! They are in Germany. They must
learn to put the responsibilities of citizenship before
sport. They must not associate with men who might
afterwards settle in Egypt and call them ‘niggers.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>These were bitter truths for my pride in England.</p>

<p class='c012'>The cheik, by the way, was born in Egypt, and
regarded as a dangerous Moslem foe! I wonder if that
can in any sense justify his exile from his native land?</p>

<p class='c012'>As he tells me: The victory of M. Kemal is the
direct result of an attempt to express the spirit of
nationalism, which will not be kept down. For the
first time Moslems have adopted the Nationalist appeal.
If that fail, you will be confronted by a Pan-Islam
uprising. The eyes of all Moslem are on Turkey.
Strike her, who is Islam’s head, and every limb will
rise in protest against the blow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As a man of God,” I protested, “you have no
right to speak of war. There must <i>not</i> be war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When responsible British Ministers refer to Salonika
as the Gate of Christendom, we can no longer
stand aside.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The Governor and all the “notables” of Ouchak
were on the platform as our luggage train arrived
“in state.” When they invited us to stay the night,
I accepted at once, without giving anyone else the
chance to refuse. After three days and two nights on
the road, I could not forego the luxury of a wash and
a change of clothes, or the chance to brush and comb
out my hair!</p>

<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>A PUBLIC MEETING AT OUCHAK—HOSPITALITY—A SACRED RITE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>At</span> Ouchak, I frankly declined to spend another night
in a luggage train. I admired the Turks’ resourcefulness
in coping with the extremely limited service of
trains—the women inside a luggage-van and the men
on the roof. I do not regret the fact that I have
probably endured even more discomfort than other
European visitors to Angora, since I have attempted
and achieved more. But for the moment it seemed
really essential to pause and rest.</p>
<p class='c012'>We were told they had only one private train car
on <i>this</i> side of the break in the line, which had been
reserved for the Minister of Finance, whom we should
probably soon meet. Engines were terribly “short,”
and most of the trains had been burnt by Greeks.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Governor drove us to the house of one of the
wealthiest men in the town, once the headquarters of
King Constantine. Our host proved to be a mere lad
of twenty, who was nevertheless directing a large
carpet factory which had partially escaped destruction,
with considerable efficiency and skill.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thanking us with graceful dignity for the honour of
our visit, he gave immediate direction for our reception
in his noble guest-chamber. He apologised for the
bareness of rooms, rifled by Greeks; but, in my judgment,
the rich and wonderful carpets were furniture
enough.</p>

<p class='c012'>As M. Kemal Pasha had taken over the house from
King Constantine, our host asked me, in joke, whose
“bed” I would choose! I naturally at once replied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>M. Kemal’s. “Ah no,” said he, “you must not decide
without seeing both.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Being always afraid of air-raids, the Greek sovereign
had taken an underground suite, certainly arranged
with great taste and every attention to creature
comfort. Lit and heated by electricity, the arrangements
closely resembled a German trench. M. Kemal
Pasha had slept on the first, or top, floor, and as I like
to think, under my white satin covering, worked with
irises. It was a proud moment for our host—that <i>I</i>
should occupy a bed already honoured by M. Kemal!</p>

<p class='c012'>I told him how at Gerbervilliers Sœur Julie once
let me sleep in a bed previously occupied by Cardinal
X., and even conferred on me the supreme honour of
using his Eminence’s sheet! That “last touch,” said
my host, he, “unfortunately, could not repeat. The
Pasha’s sheets!—well, they were not <i>here</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We soon sat down with the Governor, the Mayor,
and other “notables,” to a well-cooked meal of Turkish
delicacies, supervised by our host himself. My only
criticism of Turkish dishes is based on their “fattening”
qualities, and the pleasure in flavours which tempt one
to over-eat.</p>

<p class='c012'>More “notables” appeared for an afternoon reception,
in strange and picturesque costumes: Deputies,
hodjas, and judges. How I longed to borrow that
judge’s saxe-blue silk robe for a dressing-gown;
but, knowing that he would “give” me anything
for which I expressed a fancy, my honour sternly
forbade the request! Everyone had left their shoes
on the mat, and sat in their stockinged feet. My muddy
boots were a disgrace.</p>

<p class='c012'>They all talked Nationalism, overjoyed by the recent
victories and, I cannot deny, bitter against Great
Britain.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was invited to a big “Nationalist” meeting, to be
held that night at the Young Men’s Club, and was only
too glad to have the chance of answering the questions
I knew they would want to put. It is always wise to
encourage our critics to air their grievances.</p>

<p class='c012'>We were conducted up a rickety staircase to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>large room thick with smoke. The men were all wearing
kalpaks, and evidently puzzled at first by the “Englishwoman
in their midst.” Some of them smiled, others
plainly showed their surprise, and others just stared.</p>

<p class='c012'>After the cheik had opened the meeting in a very
few words, our host rose to explain my presence. He
told them that I had come to Angora entirely on my
own responsibility, because, though our authorities
called it “brink of war,” I wanted to convince the
Turks that we should not <i>have</i> war.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, with the Governor as my interpreter, I
begged them “to believe that Mr. Lloyd George’s
policy was <i>not</i> the policy of the English people. He
had only followed Gladstone in <i>this</i> matter, and he
had been led astray by M. Venizelos. No other
Englishman would make war on Turkey, and we, the
people, were therefore determined upon his fall.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Inch Allah</i>,” cried the people.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then I said that “whether our Conservatives or
Labour men followed Mr. Lloyd George, it would make
no difference to them. Both parties are all for peace.
I was not Turkey’s only friend in Great Britain. We
who knew were all hard at work for peace.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a strange meeting! Did the Governor really
translate what the men actually said? Some were
obviously filled with anger, though “<i>saura-saura</i> and
Mr. Lloyd George” was all I could catch. The Governor
interpreted, “The speaker does not approve of Mr.
Lloyd George’s policy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nor do I,” I replied, which made them all laugh
heartily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In any case,” I concluded, “there is not going to
be war. It is contrary to all reason, and we have been
enemies long enough! We are going to be great
friends now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I answered a host of questions, which, however,
the Governor had softened in his interpretation to
avoid hurting my feelings.</p>

<p class='c012'>Finally my host invited the audience to express
their appreciation of the visit from an Englishwoman,
who had persisted, against such terrible odds, in coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>to give them so much “news” from Great Britain;
and the old wooden roofs echoed to their cheers and
clapping.</p>

<p class='c012'>Maybe the British Government would scarcely have
approved our meeting; but there are many people in
England who take a different view; and as I told the
people, “I had been seven years on the French front
(a real slice out of one’s life) and I knew what war meant.
I will not believe our men are going to be led to war
again. However our politicians may talk, whatever
hysteria may be printed in the Press, we have sound,
practical reasons for friendship. There is nothing in
the Nationalist Pact to which Great Britain can
seriously object; nothing, certainly, to justify the
shedding of blood on either side.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After the meeting we drove back to our comfortable
quarters, and talked long into the night over tea
and cigarettes. Too tired to sleep, I told my host if
once I dozed off there would be no waking me “this
side of anytime,” so I “let myself go” upon the glories
of old England and the fine traditions of our race—a
subject my present companions were still perfectly
ready to applaud.</p>

<p class='c012'>We passed on to America and her big Press. To
their taste, British journalism is “just dry bones—without
a breath of life.” They must have something
picturesque, unrestrained by any considerations
of taste or possible hurt to the feelings of those
concerned.</p>

<p class='c012'>I told them of the strange pride with which an
American dared to boast of an “interview” with
King Constantine. “His Majesty,” as the reporter
had written, “without asking me even to sit down,
drew from his pocket a handsome case and helped himself
to a cigarette. He naturally did not offer one to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Constantine was, naturally, infuriated by the
sarcastic implication, and denied the “interview”
altogether. The “man from the States” promptly
started an “action” against him, and withdrew it, once
he had thus secured far more publicity (which means
dollars) than all the “interviews” he might have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>secured with deposed royalties, would ever have brought
his way.</p>

<p class='c012'>A lady compatriot of his, in the same spirit, once
claimed to have secured an “interview” with M. Kemal
Pasha, and wrote that “he smoked Player’s cigarettes.”
When I told her friend that this was certainly untrue,
he said: “What matters! It was good copy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was not, however, altogether surprised to learn
that this “impression” of Constantine was, most
probably, quite true. All kinds of similar stories were
in circulation about the dead monarch, but the Turkish
officers were of opinion that, though as commander-in-chief
he certainly appeared to live underground, there
was little he could be expected to achieve with the
army at his command. To be <i>fearless</i> is a commandant’s
first duty, and for that quality they were as
ready to praise the fallen Djémal and Enver as M.
Kemal Pasha himself. With all his faults and
mistakes, none could accuse Enver of fear.</p>

<p class='c012'>My “lady’s maid” on this occasion proved to be
a picturesque young woman, dressed in very bright
colours, wearing her hair in two long plaits enclosed
in a gay scarf. With the pleasant zeal of her race, she
squandered the whole contents of a beautiful Eastern
water-jug in “pouring them over my hands,” a process
which used up all the water long before I felt clean!
And not even grease and eau-de-Cologne would drive
off half the effects of these terrible days from my face.
It was a case for Turkish baths. And Nazafer, my
little maid, proved so timid and gentle a hairdresser
that I had to use some English “force” in this direction
when she had left me for the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet words cannot express the delight of this
welcome change to all the luxuries of civilisation. A
blazing wood fire, a hot bottle, and the generous supply
of white satin cushions worked in a lovely iris design
on my vast, picturesque bed!</p>

<p class='c012'>If the dogs outside could only accept their grievances
with the silent dignity of the East! As I peep through
my lattice windows over the half-ruined city, now bathed
in the silver light of the new moon, I can only marvel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>again that we hear scarcely a murmur from these
suffering people in their terrible distress. What do we
want with this mutilated country for which they are
ready to die?</p>

<p class='c012'>Here is the tale of a patriot that outstrips the
wildest imagination to have conceived. A certain
woman, so poor that she had but one miserable garment
to protect her starving babe, catches sight of some
“munitions” that are lying near her, <i>exposed</i> to the
cold! She does not hesitate a moment, but lifting her
poor child’s only covering, carefully wraps it round
the “instruments of war.” Maybe the good God
will send me another child,” she whispered; “at all
costs, my country must be saved!”</p>

<p class='c012'>How dare we attempt to hamper these people’s
freedom, bought at so dear a price? Surely the future
is <i>theirs</i> to shape as they will.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the morning is well advanced, and the sun is
streaming upon me through scarlet lace curtains, I am
at last awakened from dreams of burning cities to the
alarms of war. Downstairs, sad and bewildered faces
almost convince me that actual hostilities have begun.
But I am now fully awake, and still refuse to believe.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is absolute nonsense,” I insist on telling them.
“<i>My</i> country is <i>your</i> friend.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But even the optimism of our host had been shaken
by the pessimist newspaper reports. They all knew,
however, that, if it <i>was</i> war, I should stay with them,
and they would allow me to nurse our own “men.”...
It was not the “men” who would make war; and
I gladly repeated their high tributes to the fine soldierly
qualities of the Turk, in startling contrast to most
Germans!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Our host himself superintended the preparation of
my breakfast tray—eggs and butter, honey and jam,
fruits and cheese.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have sent me a grocer’s shop,” I exclaimed
to him later, but he waived aside my gratitude with a
casual, “Don’t mention it.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>I reminded him that he had promised I should see
“madame” and the baby. “Could not she share our
meal?” He said she was tired and really preferred
to rest. Was the excuse diplomatic?</p>

<p class='c012'>He told me that almost immediately after their
marriage (about a year and a half ago, when she was
only seventeen), they had “escaped” to Rhodes,
and it was only too likely their brief experience of
home—such as war had left them—would be once more
cruelly interrupted. She, unfortunately, did not
speak French, but I could easily read in her large,
pathetic, dark eyes the excuses she strove to offer for
what would never have struck me as “inadequate”
hospitality.</p>

<p class='c012'>I tried to convey my deep sympathy to her husband.
“You seem like a couple of dear children,” I said,
“just eager to make us all happy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Every Turk,” he replied gravely, “must marry
young. The country needs children.”</p>

<p class='c012'>M. Kemal Pasha entirely confirmed the curious
impressions that this household could not fail to produce
on any visitor from Europe. It almost made one think
of Turkey as the social Antipodes. In England so
many women are now doing men’s work, in addition
to their own. Here we see men working for both
sexes. I have no doubt the sweet little lady had
“prepared” everything in advance, but when we
arrived, she felt it becoming to disappear! It was our
host, again, whom I had surprised in the midst of his
ministrations for a most excellent lunch!</p>

<p class='c012'>The afternoon was spent in driving about the
pillaged city, visiting our host’s carpet-factory and a
number of weaving-looms in private houses. It is a
privilege, indeed, to see all these treasures of beauty
shaping before one’s eyes. It must, I think, be a great
relief for the “tired in mind” to “get busy” about
mechanical work. One’s fingers soon turn into machines,
weaving the wool in and out of the frame, cutting
the pile, the whole process of creating those
wonderful Eastern “floorings” we all admire. The
making of even “high art” goods must rest the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>nerves, like the “perpetual motion” of my Scotch
mother’s knitting needles!</p>

<p class='c012'>In the distance the cemetery looked like a large
field, glaring with poppies and cornflowers that it was
puzzling to find so late in this cold climate. As we
approached, however, the picturesque scene proved
to come from dyed wool left to dry on the tombstones,
which were, themselves, of a turban-like shape.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the market we were astonished to find how
quickly trade had recovered, almost to pre-war activity,
since my last visit. Somehow they have discovered
tools and wood to patch up booths for the old business.</p>

<p class='c012'>I told my companions I “hoped the people would
soon be given material to rebuild the whole town, that
Europe would send money in admiring recognition of
their ‘already proven’ ability to help themselves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It seemed almost a “confessional” for me, as
the officers and municipal authorities, the deputies
and the hodjas, plied me with question after question,
because they knew I would tell them all I could, and
speak the truth!</p>

<p class='c012'>They brought me photographs—of cities in ruins,
of mutilated and disfigured human beings!—unfortunately
too primitive for reproduction, but no less
invaluable as documentary evidence, almost too ghastly
for man to “look on and live”!</p>

<p class='c012'>We drove also to the aviation ground and were shown
what the officer in charge had contrived to make of
the cannon left by Greeks. Though everything was
systematically hacked to pieces, it had been all “put
together again” by the Turks with astonishing patience
and perseverance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Naturally proud of his work, and delighted to tell
us how it had all been managed, the officer, fortunately,
quite forgot I was English. He was telling us that
he found a few French 75’s, but that most of the guns
were howitzers. Suddenly realising the need for
caution, or rather courtesy, he burst out: “Cannon,
Lloyd George,” and won from us all the most grateful
and laughing applause.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was further especially pleased with his outspoken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>pride in the Turkish women aviators, of whom his own
wife had been one. All honour to them—from that
Jeanne d’Arc of Turkey, Halidé Hanoum, to every
woman who had unloaded munitions from the boats
and “done her bit” in the factories!</p>

<p class='c012'>He told us how women had watched for ships bringing
munitions as for angels of deliverance. How they
toiled at the unloading and bore their burdens with
uncomplaining zeal. No man must lift a finger for
work that could possibly be undertaken by women.
As M. Kemal Pasha says: “The women have <i>done</i>
their part in saving the country, they must <i>have</i> their
share in governing it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It has always been supposed that France supplied
most of these munitions. But the Turks paid <i>us</i>
£5,000 sterling (at the present rate of exchange) for a
load of their own munitions that we had “picked
up,” and they bought arms from the English officers
in Constantinople. Further supplies, of course, were
obtained from Frenchmen, Italians, Russians, and,
incredible as it may seem, from the Greeks themselves.
Turkey bought arms wherever she could, and set
herself the grim task of readjustment.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile, the Governor had been telegraphing
for us in all directions all day, for news of a train to
take us on our way. All the services, of course, were
disorganised, and the line cut—a message from Smyrna
to Kassaba might take twelve days! We would not
worry, or hope!</p>

<p class='c012'>At about 9.30, we hear of another luggage
train! It is not a long journey from Ouchak to
Afioun-Karahissar. We are now well supplied with food
and candles, a dilapidated deck-chair has been dug out
for me, and the cheik’s brilliant conversation will
“make history” of the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had managed to have a few words with our host’s
wife before we left the house. Her husband translating,
she thanked me again and again for my visit,
and then, asking me to excuse her going to see an ailing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>brother, she sailed away with her little babe in her
arms. As she turned smiling on us from the big
gateway, I could not resist blowing a kiss to the child-like
and pathetic figure she made—for all the world like
a schoolgirl and her doll!</p>

<p class='c012'>Towards evening, as we were preparing to leave our
host, I caught sight of a few tears rolling down his
cheeks. Like an Englishman, he quickly brushed them
aside, and turned to me with a smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>What had I said, or done? We had been skating
on thin ice all the time. I would never deliberately
hurt anyone’s feelings, but I cannot resist a joke,
and, in a foreign language, there is danger of misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found a chance of asking the cheik to tell me
frankly if I had unwittingly given any offence, for
which I would be only too eager to tender my sincere
regret and apology. But he explained: Our host’s
brother-in-law had died during the night, and, not
wishing to disturb our entertainment, his wife had
bravely set out alone to attend the funeral.</p>

<p class='c012'>So even the most intimate domestic sorrow was not
permitted to interrupt our enjoyment; the intrusion,
as it <i>must</i> be felt, of an unknown woman from an
enemy land!</p>

<p class='c012'>I have never met, even in Turkey, such a fine spirit
of hospitality. <i>My</i> tears could not be kept back.
Here was a mere lad heaping coals of fire on my head.
Again and again the words sternly echoed in my brain:
“These things should never have been.”</p>

    <div>A LUGGAGE TRAIN—THE WORST STAGE OF MY WHOLE JOURNEY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>We</span> are an hour late, the rain is pouring in torrents as
I mount from a Turk’s back to my now familiar “van”;
the station is full of friends crowding to witness our
start and say farewell.</p>

<img src='images/i104.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>From a Turk’s Back.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>After no more than an hour of what proved to be
much the worst stage of my whole journey, I was determined
against any further dependence upon “goods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>traffic.” I should infinitely prefer to walk. Our compartment,
I know, had not been chosen for comfort—there
was no other to be had. But the roof leaked,
the doors would not shut, it was impossible to keep
our candles alight.</p>

<p class='c012'>At every few kilometres there is a halt. After an
hour and a half the cheik and the officer are beyond
words. Wrapped in rugs on the cold, hard floor,
they are soon fast asleep, and now peacefully snoring.
I should have thought myself that our continual
joltings were enough to wake the dead, but my friends,
fortunately, seem able to sleep on, pitched as they are
every moment from side to side like long, shapeless
bundles of woollen stuff. I put my umbrella up and
donned a mackintosh, while our fellow-traveller, the
Inspector of Forests, is no more able to sleep than I,
but does his best to relieve the monotony by smiling at
me (since we have no common language) whenever a
candle is blown out and he patiently relights it.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was, perhaps, no more than subdued hysteria
which suddenly drove me to break the long silence with
strange sounds of laughter that awakened and clearly
startled the cheik. After a little, I managed, somehow,
to explain my unseemly outburst.</p>

<p class='c012'>The day before leaving Paris I had written to
Lord Robert Cecil in earnest endeavour to persuade
that fine enthusiast for the League of Nations that an
international “Mother of Parliaments” could never
maintain its authority under suspicion of antagonism
to Islam. Therefore, I begged him to remove the stigma
once and for all by going to Angora himself. And now
the picture had flashed into my mind of Lord Robert,
having responded to my suggestion, only to find himself
being rattled about beside me, under an open
umbrella, on the floor of a crawling luggage train in
the black darkness of a wet night.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a relief just then for all of us to join in a
good laugh; but the policy of the League has not been
helpful to Islam, and, in this matter, its unnecessary mistakes—as
I have again and again pointed out—will prove
a serious hamper to its otherwise splendid activities.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Meanwhile, our merriment is soon checked. Sudden
shrieks from the engine and an exceptionally generous
supply of jolts and bangs conjure up to my mind
awful visions of a collision in the gruesome loneliness
of the night. The cheik, however, does not share my
alarm, but calmly answers: “Methinks we do but
unrail!” To me, however, the prospect suggested
of ending my days in an Anatolian ditch, without
even the covering of my Union Jack, offers but poor
consolation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come, wake up,” I almost shouted, “it is too
terrible! Someone <i>must</i> talk to me about Islam.”
And when I realised my own selfishness in not leaving
the poor man to sleep, I could only put forth the plea:
“I am so interested in your religion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am flattered indeed,” was the immediate
response. “Religion in the East is truly a real and
living force.” At his grave words I saw again that
long line of weary soldiers among the mountains at
their prayers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall wound your feelings,” I went on, “if I
persist in questioning you about the grievances of
your people, though God knows my curiosity is not
idle.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is far better to wound my feelings and publish
the truth than to suffer the slightest risk of your
misjudging us. You may help to see us righted, for
Great Britain may have indeed ‘sinned in ignorance.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>But my allusion to Lord Robert Cecil had raised
the problem of Christianity in the East. I had to
admit that he was accused of working for “union”
between the Anglican and the Greek Churches. “He
<i>is</i> a devout, loyal and energetic Anglican, but I refuse
to believe that he would ever encourage such criminal
folly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is, indeed, too honourable,” replied the cheik.
“That is only another example of bringing politics
into religion, which must kill faith.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But does not Islam teach us that politics and
religion are one?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, indeed; that is a false, Western, interpretation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of the Koran. It is our work to-day to set free
religion from the canker of all statecraft.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I could not resist interposing at this point with my
conviction that no <i>established</i> Church can pursue wisdom;
while the insecurity of our Free Churches to-day must
always “put brakes” on their power against the
Government, and “muzzle” the <i>real</i> freedom of
thought or truth.</p>

<p class='c012'>When we got back to Greece, the cheik gave me
chapter and verse for his conviction that “if the Turks
should allow the Greek Patriarch to remain in Constantinople,
their tolerance would have degenerated
to mere weakness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was a golden dream for the Greeks, nearly
realised; but it is not for us to substantiate it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They were to drive us back into the depths of
Asia Minor, to rule over the peoples who had been their
masters for five centuries, to recapture the great
‘Bible’ towns for the Cross; to settle on the shores of
Marmora and Constantinople, that they might drive
on to Rome!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Their vision, assuredly, did not lack grandeur.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It even seemed for a little that realisation might
be achieved by zeal and ardour, until King Constantine’s
return provoked M. Briand’s famous ‘Note’ of
November, 1920, and put an end to the dream.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here I uttered a word of regret that we had not
then followed the policy of the French “surely a
course that might have saved us from all the jealousy
and suspicion we have so perversely incurred.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The cheik replied indirectly by reminding me that
M. Venizelos was not to be quite so easily, or immediately,
defeated: “A great, some say a subtle and
profound, personality, who had the <i>entrée</i> to all the
Courts of Europe. He formed in himself a strong link
between the Greek Colonies and all the Powers, particularly
England and America. He made British
friendship the pivot of ‘Greek Expansion.’ He
was not a man to bow before any discouragement or
difficulty.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now he conceived the idea, attributed to Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Robert Cecil, of union between the two Churches,
which at once enlisted the strong support of another
Cretan, Monseigneur Metaxatis, no longer Metropolitan
of Athens after King Constantine’s return.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Metaxatis was received with open arms in
America, where he devised the formation of an ‘American
Orthodox Church.’ Your Archbishop of Canterbury
was his next convert, and, thus supported, he was
able to flout Ottoman protests and to appoint himself
(or see that he was appointed) a ‘Patriarch’ at Constantinople,
under the title of Metelios IV.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I scarcely see how any real union could be
established between the Protestant-Anglican—or is it
Catholic?—Church and the Greek, if we realise the
superstitions that Greece has never thrown off. The
Greeks, whatever their faults, have always been
faithful to their old, classic religion. The superstitions,
if not the glories, of Hellas are, one and all,
upheld to-day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I said that I thought the hand of Providence could
be seen in M. Kemal’s victory, which had saved us
from this preposterous idea.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I learned later, in Angora, of the Patriarch’s
criminal disloyalty on behalf of the Greeks, I almost
wondered if Turkish religious tolerance had not been
carried too far. This wily Churchman actually dared
to make collections, <i>in Turkey</i>, for the Greek army
designed for the capture of Constantinople; openly
preached treason and rebellion. Yet he was sheltered
behind his sacred office from the captivity of General
Trécroupis at Eski-Chéir!</p>

<p class='c012'>What can we say of this Cretan, who thus dared to
tamper with our national Church? What shall we
say of his spiritual fathers who approved the plan?
What can we say for Greece?</p>

<p class='c012'>Surely the Churches, whatever their creed, should
uphold honour between all men. If the power a priest
inevitably exerts over the penitent is once abused for
political ends, religion becomes no better than treason.
We look up to those in positions of trust and
responsibility: priests, lawyers, or doctors. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>they betray their trust our sentence is doubly
severe.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The train now seems to have “put up for the night,”
but it is shaking like an earthquake; and as the rain
lashes upon us in torrents, its engine shrieks in unison
with others in the dark distance. Every moment I
expected the whole construction to collapse. It was
the old impression of the “cellars” during an air-raid,
the horrible suffocation of claustro-mania, or the
terror of being buried alive.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I must get out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You cannot. Where will you go?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall walk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will be blown away or killed on the line.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot help it. I must get out. The train is
choking me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But it may start off again any moment, and you
would be left stranded on the line.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The officer, poor man, said nothing. He knew his
duty. Whatever I might choose to do, he must accompany
me and share my fate.</p>

<p class='c012'>The inspector at last jumps out, and the cheik,
exclaiming, “If you must go, you must,” throws me
down into the arms of that sturdy and solid being,
as you might fling a cat out into the rain. Now fully
exposed to the “four winds of heaven,” the drenching
storm seemed to be tearing my hair off my head, and
I was soon ankle-deep in the thick mud; but the air
was good, and merely to be out of the train banished
all fear of being crushed to death in the darkness by
some passing steam monster.</p>

<p class='c012'>I <i>ought</i> to have braced my nerves with the thought
that Turkish women have to endure these things;
but for some reason the train terrified me. As I can
justly boast, I was terrified by nothing else in this
country.</p>

<p class='c012'>Three times they coaxed me back into that choking
van (as now and again the train shifted along for a few
miles), and three times I insisted on being tossed into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the storm. It was about two o’clock in the morning
when, to the intense relief of all, we actually arrived
at our destination.</p>

<p class='c012'>We disembark for “positively the last” time at
Afioun-Karahissar, where the deluge adds its gloom to
the now familiar woefulness of a town in ruins. Yet
many of the inhabitants are actually sleeping in the
mud of that awful night.</p>

<p class='c012'>We are driven some way beyond the town, to the
one primitive and tumble-down roof that can possibly
offer us shelter. Like most Eastern hans (<i>i.e.</i>,
inns), it is built round a courtyard, the living-rooms
next to the stable; but horses are warm and agreeable
neighbours. Once at the front, on a particularly cold
and bitter day, the French, who shrugged their shoulders
and refused none of my mad requests, politely allowed
me to travel with the horses!</p>

<p class='c012'>We climb rickety stairs and cross a wooden veranda
to examine the rooms—one with three beds, the other
with two. Alas, the former is too much for even the
cheik’s philosophy, and he decides for the courtyard.
Neither of the beds in the double room is clean, certainly,
but a marked advance on the alternative;
and, after placing the cheik’s quilt and prayer-mat
<i>between</i> myself and the “men in possession,” and
wrapping myself up in two thick rugs, I am glad
enough to “go to bed in my boots,” with at least the
prospect of “keeping still” for a few hours. If a
fire <i>has</i> brought out more “visitors” than were obvious
at our first inspection, it is still better than traffic
“by goods.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The officer is compelled literally to “sit up” all
night, as there is no room for him to stretch his
limbs.</p>

<p class='c012'>On such a night I could have wished for a “smaller”
hole in the floor, and that the “mud” walls had not
been quite so badly in need of repair; yet the shabby
and threadbare costume of the “man with our morning
tea,” was not sordid, but only picturesque.</p>

<p class='c012'>The cheik, like so many men, is an excellent housewife,
and when he laid a clean handkerchief upon a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>large volume for tray, our breakfast of bread and
helva, nuts and fruit, looked quite appetising.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not the “indolence of the East” that is
leaving these people in destitution among the ruins.
One day, what remains standing will have to be pulled
or burnt down, and a complete rebuilding undertaken.
But nothing can be done under a threat of war.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>At every inn on our return journey the whole of
the “service” was entrusted to men. This, no doubt,
largely explains the usual discomfort. Women must
not remain entirely anonymous.</p>

<p class='c012'>The cheik told me he hoped the new generation,
largely educated in Europe, might welcome such
innovations, but “it would be difficult for the old.
My wife, for instance, complained at having to ‘receive’
men visitors in Berlin. She considered it ‘cheap’
and ‘lowering’ to her prestige.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I can only hope the women of Turkey, when they
achieve progress, will advance on the right lines—more
determined on tact than pace.</p>

<p class='c012'>One must, of course, discard conventions at need,
as I was doing all the time on this journey, but one
can, at the same time, respect the feelings of others.</p>

<p class='c012'>I could not, for convention, allow my present companions
to keep up the full Eastern “separation of the
sexes”; and, as the cheik remarked, London ballrooms
would be no less offensive to Turkish ladies of
the old school than the comparatively “close quarters”
which common humanity forbade us to avoid.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are often, of course, directly opposed conventions
in different climates. In the Eastern mosques
men keep on hats and take off boots; Europeans
reverse the custom. Eastern women object to “low”
frocks and “strange” partners “for the dance”;
and, as one who had joined in them once told me, it is
better to dance alone; for, if the music suddenly stops,
a “couple” feel so embarrassed!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>We were driven to the station for a train due to leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>at 10 in the morning, which actually started about
5 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>! We had first attempted to find room in a
third-class compartment with a French colonel, a
Turkish officer, and two servants. But Europeans,
even in Asia Minor, are seldom inclined to be accommodating,
and my “ally” (!) diplomatically expressed
his desire to be left alone in his glory. “You will be
much more comfortable, my dear madam, in a less
crowded carriage. I fear you could not even find a
seat among all these officers, and, at least, fifty
boxes.” We were not slow to take the hint.</p>

<p class='c012'>However, there is no sign of being able to leave the
station for some hours, and the sun is shining for a
change. Everyone, naturally, prefers the platform;
and having learnt, it appears, that I am <i>not</i> married to
either the cheik or the Turkish officer, the colonel
approaches me with renewed curiosity. When I
explain that I am English, he simply answers: “You
mean American?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The one Frenchman and the one Englishwoman
in Anatolia,” was my retort, “have met by chance at
a wayside railway station, and you will not even allow
me to enter your carriage. Are <i>you</i> really French?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should be delighted and honoured if you will
come and talk to me,” was the would-be gallant reply,
“but I have twenty boxes” (he has quickly disposed
of thirty). “I thought at first you were a lady of
sixty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And numbered your boxes to match my years!
I see; after all, you <i>must</i> be French!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The cheik told me that Afioun means “opium,”
and Karahissar is the centre of that trade, completely
paralysed for the moment. When I had tea with Dame
Rachel Crowday at the League of Nations in Geneva,
I heard that Turkey desired to join the Opium Convention,
a striking instance of public spirit in a country
that needs all the money it can possibly lay hands on;
but the moral welfare of her people counts for more
than “profit” to the State. M. Kemal Pasha, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>has shown equal wisdom by prohibiting the sale of
alcohol. In Constantinople it was said, with a truly
“Western” hauteur: “How can the Turks imagine
that they will succeed where the United States have
made such a failure?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is that a sound argument” I replied, “for giving
them a chance of becoming what the States were
<i>before</i> prohibition? Americans do not know ‘how to
drink’; and I am afraid the Turks also might learn to
use alcohol, <i>not</i> as a beverage or a pick-me-up, but
just to get drunk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The strength and endurance of Turkish children,
nourished on bread and water, must prove of the
strongest possible support to prohibition. “And
remember how quickly the Arab’s wounds were healed
at the front, while alcohol was so effective an antidote
for septic-poisoning, because it had never before
even entered their systems.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Constantinople had proved a sore affront to my
national pride; but there was an occasion in Naples
when its humiliation was even more complete.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was passing a crowd of happy children on the quay,
rolling and tumbling about in some strangely ridiculous
fashion. Always keenly interested in children’s games
(and prayers), I went up to them and asked what they
were doing.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a game entitled “The drunken Englishman”!</p>

    <div>A THIRD-CLASS COMPARTMENT—A FRENCHMAN AMONGST THE RUINS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>After</span> a few miles of such travelling as had now become
familiar, I determined that I would change my carriage
and pay a visit to the French colonel—which proved far
more lengthy than I had intended.</p>
<p class='c012'>When I had manipulated the climb, I found plenty
of room in spite of boxes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What on earth are you doing here?” was his
first question, to which I gave him a <i>tu quoque</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am looking after the French interests in Syria,”
he replied, an answer that could not fail to provoke
a laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is well worth noting,” I said, “a parallel
to my journey from London to Edinburgh, <i>via</i> Paris!
It will make ‘good news’ for the British Foreign
Office.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And in what way can it concern them?” was
the stiff reply. “Their own record in these parts is
not entirely <i>sans reproche</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Don’t forget I am an Englishwoman and not,
as you insist on saying, an American.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it not practically the same? You speak
one language.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I started up, almost in anger. “Never dare to
say such a thing again. I might as well ask whether
you were a Senegali. The language is the same.
Individual Americans, some parts of their country, I
consider, are magnificent, but their Government!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Will any Government bear close inspection?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“You regard the States precisely as I should
expect from an Englishwoman. But, after all, what
has Great Britain done in Turkey, after ‘letting us
down’ over ‘reparations’—perfidious Albion!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I may be dense,” I returned (somewhat evasively,
I admit), “but what exactly is the connection between
Syria and M. Kemal Pasha?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everything and nothing,” was the characteristically
enigmatic reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I take that as courteous French for ‘mind your
business,’ as charming a phrase as your <i>Pourquoi-parceque</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He supposed that “I had been sent to Angora by
the British Government,” and I promised to send him
notes on my conversation with “the authorities” at
Smyrna.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Naturally,” the colonel persisted, “they would
<i>pretend</i> they had nothing to do with your undertaking;
but do they not pay your expenses?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I never heard of our Government having <i>paid</i>
a woman; I never heard of their even consulting a
woman—except Miss Bell—and, according to Colonel
Laurence, her great charm is that everyone takes her
for a man!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The colonel laughed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am absolutely independent; nor shall I send a
word to the Press unless I want to do so....
The Government may exile me or send me to prison;
so may the Turks. But I <i>shall</i> describe <i>what I see as
I see it</i>; and if anyone can prove me in error, I will
correct my statements and apologise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So few of us have the courage to write either
articles or books in the spirit of true independence
that truth demands. We writers should not be at the
beck and call of newspaper editors. We ought not
to respect their policy if it offend our conscience or
the truth. <i>They</i> should follow our lead. Had we only
had more <i>esprit de corps</i> this terribly false position of
Great Britain in Anatolia to-day could never have come
about.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If the articles in which I have told the truth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>are <i>not</i> published you will know the reason. The
editor has his opinions, and I refuse to change mine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What about the British propaganda?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is no British propaganda.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The colonel laughed, loud and long. “No country,”
he said, “has spent so much on ‘intelligence’ as
Great Britain. Gold has been poured from her coffers.
That is why she has been so badly served.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I entirely agree. We <i>have</i> squandered millions
in the Near East—in Palestine, Mesopotamia, and everywhere
else. But towards women no Government has
been so mean. It is our own fault; ‘cheap labour’
is considered patriotic; and, after all, the Government
could not find the money to squander unless
someone was willing to take their pittance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear young lady, the British are rolling in
money.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“M. Briand told the same tale till I cornered him
one day, and then he said: ‘Your country is so rich
that she can even afford to give ‘golden’ hair to her
women!’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” he replied, “I can but admire you—to
have undertaken such a journey, at such a time, without
the backing of your Government or the Press—and
all for no purpose!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are frank,” I said with a smile. “Do you
think I could have accomplished more with the financial
backing that your women can always command from
your Government?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot understand your Government.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Neither can I.... That’s why I am here.... Do
you remember the Bible story of a city offered
salvation if but <i>one</i> righteous and upright man could
be found within her gates? So, God willing, may I, as
<i>one</i> Englishwoman and a friend, preserve for my country
some last shred of respect and faith in our honour
among the Moslems of Turkey and India, Egypt, Persia,
and Palestine.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Courtesy, I suppose, kept him silent, and we were
soon busy with preparations for dinner. He produced
a towel for serviette, a piece of newspaper for table-cloth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>and—luxury of luxuries—a knife, a fork, and a
mug in which to enjoy some good French wine!
The menu, too, was a change: <i>foie gras</i> and sardines,
almonds and figs, apples and jam.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall come and dine with you again,” said I,
lest he should be too shy to invite me.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found that the colonel and his staff could fully
sympathise, from their own experience, with my
anathemas upon luggage traffic. I told him “no
doubt it was he and his friends who were making those
awful ‘night noises’ that so alarmed me”; and though,
of course, he denied it, my story received the tribute
of a polite and good-natured laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I admire your courage,” he said again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Reserve your judgment. You will have time
enough to see later what a combative person I
can be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Nous verrons.</i>”</p>

<p class='c012'>We reached Eski-Chéir at about nine o’clock, and a
telegram announced to the colonel that a special
private car was on its way to meet him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” said he, “I can offer hospitality, not only
to you, but to your friends as well.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We went to a café for tea, where numbers of Turks,
wearing kalpaks, were singing patriotic songs. Directly
they had finished, I clapped my hands, crying: “M.
Kemal Pasha, <i>Chok Guzel</i>,” and their delight was
obvious.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Poor fellows,” said the colonel, whom I began to
find sympathetic, “it needs such a tiny effort; they
will respond to the least hint of real sympathy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There is nothing sordid about this little tumble-down
café, though its floors are thick with mud and the
attendants are charmingly shabby. “At least,” I
said, “this dirt and discomfort is artistic.... What
artist would dream of painting an American sky-scraper,
luxurious and comfortable though it be? Yet here
one could cover the walls of an exhibition from one
day’s experience. The picturesque water-pots, the
quaint trays, the artistic tea-glasses and coffee-cups,
the colouring of the costumes.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“If Mr. Chester of the U.S. has come here to sweep
away all this he is an enemy of Art.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I love creature comforts—warmth, baths, and
perfumes, but I sincerely trust no fever of reform
will ever induce the Turks to spoil their surroundings;
and, above all, that they will never call in American
specialists to teach them building achievements.
By all means let them adopt American hygiene; but
American architecture, God forbid!</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will pay honour where honour is due. To all
who have so nobly perpetuated the work of Florence
Nightingale I bow the knee. But what will American
innovations do for Turkey?</p>

<p class='c012'>“In the East End of New York, America’s melting-pot,
I once saw a picturesque old Jew reading Spinoza
in the original, as he sat absorbed on the sidewalk.
His velvet cap was old and shabby, the long grizzly
beard maybe none too clean; but in the primitive
robes of his ancient race he looked a true Oriental.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then appeared his ‘American son’—a ‘Bowery’
accent, many smart rings, a costly gold watchchain
across his brightly-coloured waistcoat, spats and
patents, and a ‘time is money’ expression on his
alert face. Which of the generations would you
prefer?</p>

<p class='c012'>“If the Turk ever asks our advice, I sincerely
hope no ‘counsels from Europe’ will ever replace the
artistic traditions of the East.... Europeanised
Turks are not the ‘best’ Turks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have already, alas, in the Hippodrome at
Constantinople, that cheap, ‘made in Germany’
monstrosity of a fountain, which the once-mighty
Emperor William bequeathed to you as the ‘souvenir’
of a visit to ‘his brother,’ Abdul Hamid! Why has
war left it untouched?”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>It was a strange comfort to compare the happy
faces of these men with those one knew under the late
Sultans. In those days, two or three meeting together
in a café were always in fear of arrest as “suspects.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>I remember what songs broke forth on the Night of the
Constitution—funereal, indeed, they sounded to our
thinking, but such <i>are</i> their songs of joy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then they sang for joy, since “freedom” was too
new a thing for serious contentment; oppression had
only just been lifted, the sense of security had not
arrived. Now, in the sure knowledge of freedom from
the Greeks and from Imperial rule, they sit, calm and
confident and well satisfied, no longer an Emperor’s
slaves, but citizens of a Free State. Can one wonder
that every one of them would die rather than lose one
inch of the liberty so bravely won?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please tell them,” I asked the officer, “that I
have been in Turkey for every crisis of progress in
recent history, and that none has filled me with such
proud delight as the victory of M. Kemal Pasha. I
am here to-day to offer him my congratulations.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The colonel politely remarked that it would have
been only “prudent” speculation for the British
Government to have despatched me upon the mission
I had undertaken for myself.</p>

<p class='c012'>I thought how well it would be for many of my
compatriots to do similar work in other lands. It may
be against all our traditions, but “propaganda” could
now do much for England. Here, on the brink of
war, where all men were filled with righteous indignation
against us, I have at least been able to leave a
“better impression” of my country in wayside
cafés and many Turkish homes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet, as official language would express it, I have not
“licked the boots of the Turks,” and everywhere I
have been treated with the true courtesy of the chivalrous.
May the experience not prove to have laid the
foundation of a new and interesting career for women?
To explain in all lands, and to all envious or hostile
peoples, the true greatness of the British Empire, will
not be work in vain.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since my return I have been frequently asked to
explain the rôle of the French colonel in Angora. I
cannot feel that his presence implied any disloyalty to
Great Britain. Again and again we have been asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>by France to modify our policy in the Near East.
But as neither threats nor coaxing has availed to save
us from being the tools of designing Greece, France
was driven to “make her own arrangements.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I do not say that she abandoned Cilicia simply for
conscience’ sake, or that she gave back that rich cotton
district to Turkey from a pure love of justice. But I
am ready to congratulate her on the wisdom of retiring
before she was driven out. We must obviously own
that Angora is not on the direct road back to Syria,
and that the colonel has lingered some months by
the way. That, however, is really his own business;
and I do not forget that I, too, once went to Turkey
for six weeks and stayed six months! No doubt he
is no less welcome to M. Kemal Pasha than I was to
the Grand Vizier’s daughter.</p>

<p class='c012'>He certainly proved an invaluable source of
information. As I told him, “he must have telegraphed
to his Government every time he heard the
Pasha sneeze”; and, emphatically, he has done
good work. Honest, upright, and sincere, he can
“explain many things” to the Turks, and assist them
with tactful advice. At the worst, he has harmed no
one, which cannot be said of all diplomatists in
Constantinople!</p>

<p class='c012'>I, personally, can respect those with whom I do not
agree, even those who, on behalf of their own country,
dislike mine. It would surely have been more prudent
to <i>follow</i> the French example, by having a representative
in Angora, than to criticise them. Suspicion leads
nowhere, and such a man as General Harington “on
the spot” could have done a great deal to hasten
peace.</p>

<p class='c012'>France has no desire, or, at least, no considered
campaign, to undermine our influence in the East;
and the colonel, at any rate, was quite aware that,
whatever the gratitude Turkey may owe and feel to her,
it is England who will soon (once more) hold the first
place in Turkey’s affections. The terrible and tragic
bunglings of these last years will then be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c012'>They have told me themselves that M. Franklin-Bouillon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>did all he could to advise them to preserve
good relations with England.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The car arrived about eleven o’clock, and though
we were driven to spend the night in the station (a
junction between HAÏDAR Pasha, Angora and Smyrna);
though the wind howled over the beating rain, and the
train shrieked in the distance, the contrast of so much
comfort (on the luxurious couch of a roomy car) with
the experience of the previous night, made one feel
that the discomfort itself had been worth while.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the colonel, the cheik and the officers in turn
brought me a glass of tea by way of nightcap, I said
to each: “How good it is to be here!”</p>

  </div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>It</span> was well past ten when I woke next morning.
Though the sun was blazing through the uncurtained

<div class='ic002'>
<p>A Battle Royal with my Tangled, Dusty Hair.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There had, of course, been no chance of “undressing
for the night.” But I had been able to take off my
boots, and having a whole compartment to myself,
I was only too glad to take out my wire brush for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>luxury of a “battle royal” with my tangled and dusty
hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was still only half awake and far too tired to think
of <i>les convenances</i>, when a smiling crowd of excited
and gesticulating Turks suddenly appeared on the
platform. Truth to tell, the six-days-and-five-nights’
journey seemed like an eternity. I had forgotten
Smyrna—almost forgotten the war. Were these happy
children the “enemies” of my country?</p>

<p class='c012'>A tactful little bird now reminded me that Turks
are not used to the vision of ladies “at the toilette,”
and it was, perhaps, a somewhat perverse form of
gratitude that tempted me to fill my rubber basin
from my host’s bottle of Evian in order to wash my
hands “under the table.”</p>

<p>A Bottle of Evian—Under the Table.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Despite haste and discretion, however, I experienced
an unusual sense of being dressed and clean, as I
eventually stepped out into the daylight to make the
acquaintance of Eski-Chéir.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found the colonel on the platform talking with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>animation to a nice-looking Turkish general, who also,
it appeared, had a saloon, to which we all three soon
adjourned for coffee and talk. He, too, will scarcely
believe that I am English.... “I did not think Englishwomen
could laugh so heartily,” was his excuse for
scepticism.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear sir,” I replied, “I was born laughing,
and shall keep it up to the bitter end. God has
given me a few gifts—not many—and that for which
I give most thanks is a keen sense of humour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So I trotted out all the experiences of my journey
one by one, not forgetting the Greek I had to “shake”
at Athens, and the Frenchman in the “Caracole.”
Convulsed with laughter, they one and all shouted:
“She is <i>not</i> English!”</p>

<p class='c012'>This strange impression of our race prevails, I
know, also in France and America. They forget
Shakespeare’s Falstaff and the supreme “good fellowship
of English laughter.” French wit, no doubt,
reveals the swift play of a keener and more subtle
intellect; ours is a “midsummer madness” of warm
hearts in the Forests of Arden.</p>

<p class='c012'>For my part, when the “literature” mistress
challenged her class to “hunt for humour” in “Julius
Cæsar,” I put my finger upon the Stage Direction—“Enter
Cæsar in his nightgown!” I could not then,
nor can I now, agree that Brutus’s wife’s distracted
hurrying away, and then recalling, the page for
news of his master is anything but tragic pathos.</p>

<p class='c012'>Few nations, again, will enjoy as we do a joke against
themselves. When I published a “Turkish Woman’s
Impressions of Europe,” about ten years ago, in which
she so happily hit off the weakness of our Western
civilisations, the Continent was up in arms. It was
an <i>English</i> critic who gaily expressed his “most sincere
thanks” for so “thorough a dressing-down.” No
publisher in the States would take the following book,
with Americans as “victims,” for fear of his “sensitive”
and “patriotic” (!) readers.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>At a half-ruined restaurant near the station, over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the most excellent meal I ever tasted in such miserable
surroundings, we had a long talk with General Mouedine
Pasha and his two sons about politics and some
curious stories they had heard somewhere about
England. It is natural that these men should not
be interested in any other subject. The general, he
told us, had been in and out of prison for the last
fifteen years—exiled by Abdul Hamid, escaping, and
caught again. After the Armistice he left Constantinople,
at great personal risk, to join M. Kemal
Pasha; was, for a time, Governor of Adana, and is
now taking up his post as Ambassador at Teheran.
Most of the leading soldier Nationalists—M. Kemal
Pasha and Fethi Bey among the rest—seem to have
been his grateful pupils, and, naturally, he is a proud
man to-day.</p>

<p class='c012'>If only the authorities at Lausanne had known or
could imagine anything about life in Angora during
the last three years! All the best men exiled, persecuted,
and imprisoned. What wonder that Nationalism
had grown into a religion!</p>

<p class='c012'>He was indignant at the suggestion that French
officers, or a British strategist, were “wanted” in
the Turkish Army. “My pupils,” he said, “are more
fitted to <i>give</i> instruction than to receive it....</p>

<p class='c012'>“The buying and selling of munitions, the haggling
and bargaining introduced in the army—all that ought
<i>not</i> to be—came from Germany.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was not the <i>only</i> “big man” in Turkey to lose
faith in their war-ally, or to recognise some compensation
for their terrible defeat in the freedom from Teuton
rule that it involved; but they are not, therefore,
any more kindly disposed to the yoke of “the
Allies.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Eski-Chéir had been one of the most flourishing
towns in Anatolia, and was destined from its position
as a junction between two big railway lines—Angora
and Baghdad—to become more prosperous year by
year. Every town, of course, has its own story of
looting, “violation of women,” and fire; but to the
spectator all now seem very much alike, and what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>chiefly impressed one here was the amazing rapidity
with which it had started to recover.</p>

<p class='c012'>If the produce be only lifted from the backs of
patient and sure-footed donkeys on to the Mother Earth,
it is, after all, extraordinary that there should
yet be any produce left. Peasants ready to walk
miles along muddy roads to sell their goods in such small
quantities for so little profit will scarcely welcome the
cost of transport by modern methods. For them, time
is <i>not</i> money, and four weeks’ tramp beside a donkey is
far cheaper than a few hours by train.</p>

<p class='c012'>It surprised me to find the curio-merchants already
again supplied with their tempting wares: mother-o’-pearl
ikons and other relics, old coffee-mills, coral
seals, cameos, etc. Trade was fairly brisk, being run
on the sound basis of quick profits and small returns,
fair prices and honest dealing.</p>

<p class='c012'>The attractions, of course, come nowhere near those
of the famous bazaar at Constantinople; but I was
grateful to find so little haggling over the price. I
remember two types of merchants at Constantinople.
One kindly-looking old man with a long white beard
was sitting cross-legged over his charcoal fire, making
himself a cup of coffee. When I inquired about a
fine Persian dressing-gown that took my fancy, he
simply answered: “Much too dear for you,” and so
dismissed me. The other always asked for three times
what he was prepared to accept—a most irritating
habit. When I visited the bazaar in Turkish dress,
my Turkish sister, of course a real Turk, asked if
he really found he <i>could</i> rob people in this way. “I
never rob Turks,” was the naïve reply, “only the English
and the Americans.” The temptation to disclose
my nationality was strong, but in those less liberal
days it might have meant “trouble” for my friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here I soon saw it would be waste of time to visit
<i>any</i> bazaar after the French colonel. He counts it a
day wasted if he has not found some treasures, which
are all sent for him to Paris.... “Poor man,” as
my friend the innkeeper would have remarked, “he is
so far from home!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>In Eski-Chéir before the fire, however, art had been
altogether put away for munitions. The factories
worked day and night, cannons and lorries in readiness
all the time. One day we shall learn something at
least of the ceaseless efforts by which victory was
snatched out of nothing.</p>

<p class='c012'>We left the town at about ten o’clock in the evening.
At last we are actually <i>en route</i> for Angora. “I
cannot even yet quite believe,” said I, “that I am really
starting, that I shall really arrive.” I heard that
some American women (more enterprising, or less
expensive, than their confrères) have reached Ismidt,
but can get no further.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was, indeed, “hard-going,” and I believe that
the colonel’s “salon” only just came in time. I was
told, four years ago, by the eminent Jean Louis
Faure, that <i>if</i> I survived at all it would be as a permanent
and complete invalid. Yet I have faced more
since then than most “strong” people would care to
attempt.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Turks, remember, who could not obtain or
afford a yaili (the native carriage) were driven to
“walk” the eight hundred miles to Angora in a climate
that more than doubles the strain on one’s physique.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>As soon as we meet new faces, the questions about
Lloyd George all begin over again.</p>

<p class='c012'>I told the story of <i>Les Misérables</i>. How the
ambitious Welsh lad and his uncle, the village cobbler,
“worked at the French” together in the old days, one
looking out “what a word meant” in the dictionary,
the other discovering how to pronounce it. Mr. Lloyd
George had often declared that the policy of his whole
career came straight from his first study of that immortal
classic—“to devote his life to helping the
‘under dog.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps he has lost the copy of <i>Les Misérables</i> he
used always to carry with him, and so missed the road
to that magnificent goal; so, at least, it seemed to
my Turkish audience. “That is the man, a democrat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>who could understand and appreciate our fight for
freedom; what has driven him to hate us?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I could only repeat such “explanation” as I had
been able to offer before to their compatriots of the
mountains.</p>

<p class='c012'>The colonel was kind enough to suggest how much
I might have saved England had I been here a year
ago.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is very doubtful,” I answered, “whether I
could have done much, even then. Our Government
makes up its own mind without listening to outside
information. As a matter of fact, Colonel Aubrey
Herbert, a <i>recognised</i> authority on the Near East, called
twice at 10, Downing Street, to urge that very scheme
upon the Premier’s private secretary, Mr. Philip Kerr,
but they preferred to keep me in England.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why is your ‘intelligence’ so badly
managed?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What evidence can you produce for such an
assumption?” was my retort.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There could surely be no other explanation of
your leaving the Greeks without support ... unless,
indeed, they are right who whisper that Mr. Lloyd
George actually wanted the opposing armies to exterminate
each other. His conduct, certainly, lent
colour to the charge.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But I refused to be drawn.... “‘Intelligence’ is
not my province,” I answered, “although I <i>can</i> say
that the Turks were not served much better in that
respect.... They won by ‘faith’; what we of the
West call ‘superstition.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was able to more or less look after the son of an
eminent Turkish lady writer during his studies in
Paris, just after the Treaty of Sèvres. His father,
one of the leading Governors under the last administration,
had given up all to follow M. Kemal Pasha.
When I asked the boy whether they had any hope of
success, he just flashed out: “They <i>must</i> succeed.
His stars are ‘right.’ He <i>could</i> not fail!”</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, Turkish diplomats, one and all,
declared he would fail.</p>

<p>GENERAL MOUEDDINE PASHA.<br /><span class='sc'>Military Instructor of Mustapha Kemal Pasha.<br />Turkish Ambassador at Teheran (Persia).</span><br />p. 128</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“Must such splendid efforts be thrown away?” I
sadly answered; “are there <i>no</i> circumstances that
<i>might</i> arise to justify at least some hope?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“My dear lady,” was the courteous and grave
reply, “we <i>wish</i> him success, as you do; but you
have too much good sense to believe in fairy tales.
The Pasha has neither money nor munitions. He
has the Greeks (well supported by the Allies and the
Sultan) against him on the north, the Armenians on
the east, the French on the south. He will put up a
brave fight and perish in the attempt. The days of
miracles are past.” But the miracle happened!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>And now, as the train followed the line of the
victorious army, our young men took out their maps
and eagerly pointed out to us these, now almost sacred,
landmarks. Their father, at the same time, explained
many technical details—why such and such a position
could not be maintained, where the Greek strategy
had failed, how General Trécoupis (now thankful, no
doubt, to be in the Turks’ hands at Eski-Chéir) had
surrendered to a mere lieutenant.</p>

<p class='c012'>By way of return for all this interesting information,
I told a few simple stories about the Royal Family
of Great Britain, which I have always found interest
these people far more than my “grander,” or more
romantic, reminiscences from the Courts of Europe.</p>

<p class='c012'>They are never tired of hearing that our Edward
VII. only required <i>one</i> “gentleman in waiting” at a
time at Marienbad; whereas the Czar (Ferdinand)
of Bulgaria was always accompanied by a suite of
eight or nine. Sir Edward Goschen was instructed to
dress, like his royal master, in a green Tyrolese hat
with its little shooting feather. He was sent to sit on
“the king’s bench” until the crowd had satisfied
their natural desires for “a good view,” and gone home
to breakfast. <i>Then</i> Edward VII. himself arrived.</p>

<p class='c012'>I went on to tell of a Wagner concert, so crowded
that a certain little American lady of about seventy
quietly settled into the only empty seat that the King’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>attendant just happened to have vacated. She simply
“refused to believe” the scandalised authorities
when they told her that she was sitting beside the
King of England. Edward enjoyed the joke, would
not allow “his friend,” to be disturbed, and chattered
merrily to her between the music to the end of the
programme.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her countrywomen, in Ascot gowns, driving their
four-horse carriages up to the golf-course at Marienbad,
<i>in search of</i> an introduction, did not find His
Majesty so easy to approach. The most determined
of them all (up against something that “money” could
not buy) was driven to use her scissors to cut off a
few hairs from his dog’s tail. “At least,” she said,
“if I have no souvenir of the King of England, I have
a bit of his dog,” and she mounted the hairs in a
locket and wore it until she died.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You see,” I concluded, “how much these ‘democrats’
admire a king. Will the fever, I wonder, ever
take root in the East?”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>When we reached the Sakharia, the eyes of the
general were filled with tears, and it was some time
before he managed to speak of what <i>had been</i>. It
seemed, indeed, too good to be true. The Greeks
had penetrated to Sakharia; and now they were
driven out of the whole country!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Without our Pasha,” said he, “we should still
be slaves. To-day, none dare fail in duty to our
Fatherland!”</p>

<p class='c012'>They were all this man’s pupils, these Nationalist
leaders. To his fine, upright character they owe an
example they are proud to acknowledge. His sons
told me that he was in exile for six years, and they had
no idea where he was! It was easy to see how they
admired him and how devoted he was to them; and
now his work at Teheran will not be easy; such men
give their whole lives to service!</p>

<p class='c012'>We have travelled quickly and comfortably over
this desolate country; the little engine, <i>stoked with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>wood</i>, is tugging its long burden up the long heights.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look,” said the colonel, “there is Angora.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That little village perched on a hill?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is not a village,” he corrected, “it is a town.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet somehow I felt this was not what I had
expected ... “such a tiny speck of a place to bear
so great a name!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Well, I had my first peep at that which I had come
so far to see—the cradle of the New Turkey. Soon
I shall meet the hero of the Nationalists!</p>

    <div>ANGORA I.—ENTERING A “BROTHERHOOD”—AN ATMOSPHERE OF CAMARADERIE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>“Well</span>, what did you expect to see?” asked the
colonel.</p>
<p class='c012'>“Really, I don’t know exactly,” said I, “but
something different.... I suppose I am foolish
enough to look for some sort of likeness to our Western
towns.... There is a certain resemblance in parts
to a town in the Rhondda Valley, except that the Welsh
mining districts are sordid and this is picturesque.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why not leave it as it is,” said the colonel—“unique
and impossible to classify? Begin your
explorations at my house, where you can enjoy another
glass of warm tea.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This, in fact, was the first house I entered, and the
last I left, in Angora.</p>

<p class='c012'>On a crowded platform—for the arrival of a train
is an event—stood a Chef de Cabinet of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and other officials. The Prime
Minister embraced his old friend the cheik, and carried
him off to his simple two-roomed dwelling.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I met Fethi Bey in London, it seemed incredible
that he should have been treated as an enemy
and exiled to Malta. Now that I came to know Rauf
Bey, it was impossible not to feel the same. Away
in these distant mountains, he speaks the most excellent
English, without even an accent.</p>

<p class='c012'>I remember a merchant of Smyrna, who complained
to me that “these horrible people expect us to learn
their language, to speak and write it.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“And why not?” I answered. “They learn
ours.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, that’s quite different. Besides, Turkish is
much too difficult.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I reminded him of Mrs. John Burns. When her
husband became a Cabinet Minister, a certain fine
lady decided to amuse herself by inviting “the man’s
wife” to tea. Her note ran: “Do excuse my not
having called on you. It is so far for me to come from
Mayfair to Battersea.” Mrs. Burns replied: “It is
exactly the same distance from Battersea to Mayfair.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That is a charming story, but it will not persuade
me to learn Turkish.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Prime Minister, for some reason wearing a fez
in place of the picturesque kalpak, brought me
apologies for Fethi Bey’s absence. “It is Friday, and
he has not been to the office all day.” We had all
forgotten that it was the Moslem Sunday.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now we are going to be friends,” I said later to
Rauf Bey, “we must arrange ‘the same day’ for
our prayers of thanksgiving for peace.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is you who will have to change,” he replied,
smiling; “you must learn to go our ways now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here, indeed, at this far-away little station, one
seemed to be entering some kindly “brotherhood.”
Everyone was wringing the colonel’s hand, embracing
the general and the cheik. I felt, too, that my fellow-passengers
were telling them about “a new member”
they wanted to introduce, saying heartily: “She will
soon know all about the rules of our club.” Everyone
here plainly “stood for” the same ideals. We are
talking like friends already, without the formality of
an introduction. We are all working for a definite and
well-defined goal. Houses are scarcely needed for hospitality
in a town with this atmosphere of <i>camaraderie</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>I found myself chatting with the Prime Minister as
though we were old members of the same club. When, a
few minutes later, I described the unconscious influence
to the colonel, he only said to his friends: “See how
quickly she catches the atmosphere of this delightful
place!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Here it is sympathy with Turkey in her bid for
freedom that gives one the <i>entré</i> to the society, as
in London one gains admission to the club, in my case
for example, as a writer of books. There is no sense
of suspicion. You feel you have a right to be here
all the time. If you were not <i>trusted</i> you would not
be allowed over the threshold.</p>

<p class='c012'>Soldiers and refugees, officers and deputies, they are
all on the platform. Everybody has seen us, everybody
has greeted us; next morning the kindest little paragraph
of welcome appears in the newspapers. I have
completely forgotten the war!</p>

<p class='c012'>The colonel lives on the first floor of what was in
the “beginning of days” the Station Hotel. M.
Kemal Pasha himself lived there for a time, and now
it is the “French Embassy.” Fortunately, the colonel
has schooled himself into <i>imagining</i> a house is warm,
whatever the temperature; and I found him very comfortably
installed, with plenty of fresh air and a fine
open view. Within, however, there were, except in
the bureau, no rugs or carpets on the bare boards.</p>

<p class='c012'>To secure the luxury of a European wash, I decided
to spend the night in the station, where the young
secretary gladly gave up his room to me, making a
bedroom of the bureau for himself and the colonel’s
aide-de-camp, Captain Hikmet Bey, after we had all
enjoyed a very appetising little meal.</p>

<p class='c012'>The “Catholic” servant, however, was frankly
annoyed at having to wait on an Englishwoman—“that
hateful intriguing race that killed my husband!”
He was killed, as a matter of fact, by the Greeks, but
we are, not unnaturally, held responsible, and once
more I realised how little “brotherhood” there exists
between Christians. I confess it is always with an
effort that I remember Armenians <i>are</i> Christians. In
the end, however, Marie decided that I was not really
English, and we became the best of friends. When I
left Angora she shed many tears, kissing my hand,
placing it against her forehead in the picturesque custom
of her race, and begging me to come back soon.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I handed her my rubber hot-bottle, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>apparently supposed I did not care to use the jug which
already stood on the table, and filled it with <i>cold</i>
water! When she understood that the water must be
hot, she brought it back to me to wait and watch what
I would do with it. The idea of putting it in my bed
made her laugh heartily; and then she decided to sit
down and see whatever would happen next!</p>

<p class='c012'>But I was tired, and, with none to interpret, began
to wonder how I could send her away. My phrase-book,
as usual, did not provide the clue, so I merely
pointed to the door, saying <i>kapou</i> (a door), which
luckily had the desired effect. But she was back again
as soon as she dared in the morning, to enjoy more
laughter at the sight of the hot-bottle by my side.</p>

<p class='c012'>The principal road from the station to “Holy
Angora” is wide enough for three or four carts to pass.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here are two-horse carriages, their primitive harness
decorated with turquoise beads, driven by picturesque,
shabby Arabaje (<i>i.e.</i>, coachmen) in turbans of many
colours. Also the yaili, so called from their springs,
and the famous Anatolian log-carriages, drawn by
bullocks. By the <i>side</i> of the road, sunk in the snow or
mud, are the heavy carts drawn by buffaloes and driven
by women, who wear the large, baggy, Anatolian
trousers, and conceal their hair beneath a scarf. Their
clothes, poor souls, are so nearly covered with patches
that some of them seem “all patch.” The men all
wear kalpaks, and we see the peasants (men and
women) riding their laden donkeys or trudging along
beside beasts as patient as themselves. They look as
though they had walked straight out of the Bible.</p>

<p class='c012'>The main road passes the Grand National Assembly
on the way to the few shops. The restaurants make a
fair show of Turkish delicacies, like your ekmek-kadaïf,
and kébab. We pass two hans (<i>i.e.</i>, inns) as
primitive in comfort as appearance, built of mud in
which large holes can be seen, and full of danger to the
unwary on their rickety staircases. The “commercials”
in their yailis, on camels or donkeys,
however, can find no other or better accommodation.
There are pictures of Ghazi Pasha all over the town,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>and in one or two bookshops you can also buy his
principal colleagues, patriotic postcards, and other
“Nationalist” pictures in gaudy colours.</p>

<p class='c012'>At quaint little booths in the market-place we find
a tempting array of fruit, vegetables, and meat, bread
and cheese, raisins, nuts, and boots!</p>

<p class='c012'>And, finally, we reach a few dwelling-houses of wood,
stone, or mud that do not seem to have been built on
any plan, and now look more irregular than ever
because of the huge “gap” on the hillside caused, of
course, by the usual fire!</p>

<div id='i136'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i136.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Market-place at Angora.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The weatherbeaten mud and thatch dwellings are
whitewashed inside, and have plain wooden doors
with handsome knockers and quaint, huge locks. They
are mostly heated by mangals of burning charcoal
that give out poisonous fumes. However, the wood-stoves
are not much better, as they quickly produce
an intense heat and then die down as quickly, besides
the danger of setting the whole place on fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is difficult to find one’s way in Angora, but the
coachmen are wonderful. They “take” anything in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>their headlong course, so that one is constantly jolted
out of one’s seat as the carriages swing from angle
to angle, up and down the steep slopes. To start from
the Ottoman Bank on a wet day requires a double dose
of fatalism.</p>

<div id='i137'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i137.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“The carriages swing from angle to angle.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Ismet Pasha was much amused when I told him that
I always said my prayers before starting out for a
drive, and uttered some “holy ejaculation” every
five minutes of the way. Even a handsome car like
M. Kemal Pasha’s can be seen dancing about like
Shakespeare’s elf—“over hill, over dale, through bush,
through briar!” A chauffeur who can pilot you
through Angora could negotiate any country under
the sun.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was as well, perhaps, that my host, Feszi Bey,
had arranged for me to be driven to his house under the
cover of darkness, when pitfalls were not so obvious.
He is Minister of Public Works, and was at the moment
attending the debate on the dethronement of the
Sultan. As none of his family speak French, Osman
Noury Bey, of the Ottoman Bank, had been instructed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to act as my escort, and we found them all in the
sitting-room, with its lattice windows at each end,
round as large a fire as it was safe to have. The heat
was almost overpowering after our brisk drive in the
night air.</p>

<p class='c012'>Osman Noury Bey was obliged to leave me on the
threshold, as he could not enter the women’s apartments.
While the <i>harīm</i> and sex-separation are
not now rigidly enforced by the most educated Turks,
they have not by any means yet disappeared. I found
that the whole “woman” question was really on much
the same footing in Anatolia as in other countries;
that is, “liberty” varies with education, upbringing,
and surroundings. In this house the women were
closely veiled and dependent upon their own sex for
all their pleasures and companionships. Osman Bey
himself is thoroughly liberal-minded and would have
allowed his wife full freedom, provided only her hair
was covered, but she goes out very little and clearly
prefers the old ways.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, the wife of Djavid Bey, ex-Minister
of Finance, goes to private dances; while
Halidé Hanoum goes everywhere and has mixed freely
with men for many years. Yet I, a woman, have
never seen her hair unveiled.</p>

<p class='c012'>While we were waiting for my host’s return, I did
my best to “make conversation” by signs and gestures,
and was really surprised at my success. You can
convey far more than one would suppose when you
seriously endeavour to <i>make</i> your company understand.
I had my book, too, of “conversations in Turkish,”
and so managed to remark: “The house is large—the
fire is warm—I like a warm fire.” Had I depended
upon the women in Turkey, I might soon have learned
something of their language.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our host arrives, and he is kindness and courtesy
itself.</p>

<p class='c012'>At about half-past nine, his Excellency asked me
when I would like to dine.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whenever you are ready,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no,” was the courteous reply, “it is when <i>you</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>are ready. <i>Vous maître maison, moi votre service.</i>”
Too charming a thought for one to examine the
accuracy of the language!</p>

<p class='c012'>He was always amused to see me “hunting” in
the dictionary; and as I could <i>never</i> get used to “beginning
at the end and reading backwards,” my most
painstaking researches often produced strange results.</p>

<p class='c012'>Like most of the Nationalist ministers, Feszi
Bey is a man of about forty, tall, well-built, dark, with
large dark eyes. He is one of the richest men in
Asia Minor, owning about eighteen villages in Diarbékir,
and is immensely proud of his sons. His house
in Constantinople was “requisitioned” for English
officers and left almost in ruins; but he has large
estates and many houses in his native land. Here, in
Angora, he was paying what seemed to be a heavy rent
for somewhere to live, considering the scanty furniture
and lack of comforts in this house.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ground-floor was occupied by kitchens and
another room which the merciful man had given up to
his horses, leaving his carriage outside in the rain and
snow. Though not in any way like a stable, the animals
were clearly well-cared-for here. A very steep wooden
staircase, certainly <i>not</i> built for ladies’ high heels,
leads to a central room—almost a “lounge”—which
opens into four others. It was dimly lit by candles,
a survival from war-days when petrol was worth its
weight in gold—literally two hundred francs a litre.</p>

<p class='c012'>Feszi Bey has been in Angora ever since the movement
began, and has acquired that striking expression
of a set, firm resolve which I notice on the faces of all
his colleagues. I asked him whether he did not “sometimes
tire of living in this bare and rough Asiatic fortress,
so far from all means of culture or distraction.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have our work,” he replied; “too absorbing
and too important to leave us time for complaint. We
do not even ‘miss’ our comforts, or need more than
an hour or two’s sleep. There is so much to plan for
our new country, the day, and most of the night, are not
long enough.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here one naturally feels far more in “New Turkey”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>than at Smyrna; the impression grows on one day by
day. At Lausanne I tried to make them understand
that they were still busying themselves over a Turkey
that is dead.... “You can’t talk to these people as
you were accustomed to speak under the Sultans,
they would not understand you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They only smiled at a woman carried away by her
emotions. But they were wrong; this is no question
of sex. The very ramparts, clear-cut in the distance
like gigantic razor-blades, the very remains of the
Roman, even the Seldjoucide and Osman, civilisations
which halted among these hills, will bear witness to the
birth of a new nation!</p>

<p class='c012'>As I gaze out over the mountain-tomb of Timourlin
a voice seems to cut through the chill air: “Here is
a glory that will not perish. Here, where the civilisations
of the world’s childhood have flourished;
here, on the ruins of the great Empire of the Ancients;
here beginneth a new Turkey, the democrat
of democracies!”</p>

    <div>ANGORA II.—AT THE HOME OF MY KIND AND COURTEOUS HOST</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> next morning we breakfast, “when I am ready,”
which is 8.30. My host’s face beams with delight,
and the generous <i>menu</i> could hardly fail to put
“the guest” in good spirits—toast and boiled eggs
(my allowance being half a dozen a day), biscuits and
cheese, olives, and glasses of tea.</p>
<p class='c012'>In Nationalist houses “reading the papers” and
discussing foreign telegrams have become almost a
religious rite. This morning, clearly, there is “good
news”! The very air we breathe seems lighter,
faces look less anxious, men are greeting each other in
hopeful tones! What can it be?</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, I am not kept long in suspense—“Mr.
Lloyd George is a fallen angel!” Well, certainly, I
shall not go into mourning; but, at the same time, the
animosity thus so sharply revealed makes one sad
for one’s own country.</p>

<p class='c012'>With their inborn tact, my friends suggest that we
all go to the Pasha’s to celebrate, <i>not</i> the fall of a “Lost
Leader,” but the prospect of the Conservatives’
return to power.</p>

<p class='c012'>To them, as in England, the change is welcome for
the long vista of possibilities it opens up. Shall we
resume the Beaconsfield traditions without Gladstone’s
sentimentality? Will Mr. Bonar Law find
means to justify our faith? It is obviously early days
yet for any assurance in prophecy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet, if the exit of Mr. Lloyd George delighted the
Continent and the Near East—as if a modern Nero had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>been assassinated—I, for one, could only think with
sorrow upon the “splendour of opportunity” which
he has missed and lost. No man, since the world began,
ever held in his hands such a power for good in England
and among all nations. He could have raised the
prestige of Empire to even greater heights and led the
councils for peace.</p>

<p class='c012'>Almost the contrary has come to pass. To-day,
certainly, our faith, our good word, our justice, and our
fair play (without which England is <i>not</i> England) are
almost everywhere subjected to suspicion and distrust.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Turks tell me it is as easy “to buy” one of
our officers as those of other nations, that they have
done so over and over again in Constantinople, I try
to say that it cannot be. When my host tells me they
paid £6,000 sterling for our men’s assistance to charter
a boat and escape from Malta, I can only admit, in
silence, that they did—somehow—escape. When I
learn that at least <i>one</i> correspondent in Constantinople
is subsidised by the Greeks, I can bear no more.
Whence have bribery and corruption invaded our
country against the traditions of centuries? I told
them I used to feel that “I was sitting on a rock amidst
howling and roaring seas; now even the rock itself is
sinking.”</p>

<p class='c012'>To pay honour where honour is due, I compliment
the Minister on the splendid “foreign” news of both
his papers—the <i>Tanine</i> and the <i>Vakit</i>. I wish to-day
that I knew the language and could read the articles by
Hussein Djahid and Ahmet Emine. Even translated,
I find them full of sound commonsense and beautifully
written. If at times they are bitter, there is none
of that sensationalism which our Press has lately
borrowed from the States.</p>

<p class='c012'>My host is due at his office at 9.30, but, though
he has ventured to glance at his watch, the talk
continues. At about 10.30, I casually ask: “Are you
not going to your office to-day?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When you allow it,” was the startling answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, surely, time is of importance at least to a
responsible Minister? Yet he will cheerfully give up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>an hour of his sleep (for that is what it will mean) to
my entertainment, because I have forgotten <i>my</i> duty.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do not hesitate,” he went on, “to tell me of
anyone you would specially like to meet, man or woman.
It shall be arranged.... Fethi Bey will lunch with
you to-day. Whom else shall I invite?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I said that I should, one day, like to see Younous
Nadi Bey, the editor of <i>Yeni Gun</i> and President of
Commission for Foreign Affairs in the Grand National
Assembly. “He must be interesting, since our Press
describe him as a ‘man who ought to be shot’!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I found this gentleman, as I expected, well worth
going out of one’s way to meet. Without the exquisite
manners of Hussein Djahid Bey, he is one of those men
who, having made up his own mind about right and
wrong, never hesitates to act.</p>

<p class='c012'>At any rate, until he <i>is</i> shot, he will not allow the
Government to sleep, nor to trust Europe without
sufficient guarantees. He graciously wrote in <i>Yeni
Gun</i> that I had given him some very valuable information
about our policy. I certainly did my best to
explain Lord Curzon’s position. Neither he nor Fethi
Bey, however, could understand how he could stay in
the new Cabinet. I scarcely expected that they, or
any foreigner, could realise the full measure of England’s
folly in putting the whole machinery of government
into one man’s undisputed control. Like everyone
else nominally in power, the Foreign Minister
became a mere cypher.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why did he stand it?” they asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For the moment, no protests would have had
any effect. His resignation might easily have brought
in a far more complete collapse, and, meanwhile, he
probably felt that the interests of Conservatism were,
to a large extent, in his hands. Lord Curzon knows
the East, and he knows what <i>ought</i> to be done. As
Goethe says: ‘Between the knave and the fool, one
should always choose the knave.’... <i>Gegen die
Dumheit, kämpfen die Götte selbst vergebens.</i> (Even
the gods fight in vain against stupidity.)”</p>

<p class='c012'>Again and again I try to assure them that our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>policy in Turkey is going to “come right.” When
they politely retorted that we “did not seem in any
great hurry to start turning,” I could only suggest
that “Empires, like whales, could not quickly change
their direction.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Younous Nadi Bey is a most interesting talker.
Like so many of the Nationalists, he “comes from”
Malta; like them all, he loves his country sincerely,
and is eager to protect her. Can we expect these men
to trust the Power that, only three months ago, was
doing its best to destroy them? For myself, I could
only hope that we should soon give them sound reason
to change their opinions.</p>

<p class='c012'>I afterwards paid a visit to Younous Nadi at the
offices of the <i>Yeni Gun</i>. After coffee in his primitive
“editorial sanctum,” I was shown over all the “works.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The illustrations are prepared with a hand machine,
which reminded me of our school magazine activities;
but the “results” are, if anything, rather better than
our own “dailies” achieve.</p>

<p class='c012'>The operator had built his bed over the solitary
press, in part, no doubt, to save time, but possibly also
with the idea of protecting his “treasure.” The
editor apologised for the lack of all our modern processes
of production. I was the more inclined to
compliment him upon his conquest of difficulties.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is surely a <i>tour de force</i> to “get the news” from
this Anatolian machinery, and there are sixty papers
in Anatolia!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>We were staying in the Hadji Baïram quarter of Angora,
so called from the mosque and turbé erected in
memory of that sainted man. My host’s house stands
on the edge of a hillock, exposed on all sides to the
rain or wind or snow. No carriage can drive up to
the doors, and, too often, that last hundred yards’
walk means being soaked to the skin. Any number of
stray dogs and cats find shelter in its many doorways,
howling and whining all through the night.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>My guide is supposed to call for me at ten o’clock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>in the morning, but I have often enough rejoiced at
his indifference to the clock. There is so much to
sketch from our front door: an unused cemetery,
with moss-covered stèles (tombstones) lying in picturesque
confusion; a tumble-down shepherd’s hut;
a crumbling mosque; mud houses in need of repair; and
for background, a steep hill crowned by Timourlin’s
tomb.</p>

<div id='i145'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i145.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“There is so much to sketch from our front door.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>While painting, I have counted just four passers-by—two
men leading their fruit-laden donkeys, and two
women taking their asses to drink. No artist can
resist Oriental landscapes; and genius, I suppose,
would hardly remember to share my longing for nice
warm “Western” baths in an atmosphere that
means “microbes” in summer and in winter all kinds
of discomfort.</p>

<p class='c012'>The “sights” for tourists do not delay one many
days. There are excellent “Red Cross” hospitals,
a military hospital, an école normale for girls, a military
school, the Ministries, town gardens, the Armenian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Orphanage, the “Embassies,” and the Ottoman Bank.
One can also enjoy long drives through miles of
uncultivated land.</p>

<p class='c012'>These various “institutions,” particularly the
educational, are full of interest if one had time to
thoroughly investigate the whole system, since probably
no civilisation in the world differs so radically from our
own.</p>

<p class='c012'>Explorations, however extensive, must all be over
before five o’clock. For as the eastern sun sets in its
glory, we all go home—ministers and deputies to plan
and work, the rest of the population to talk and wonder
what the “great folk” are doing.</p>

<p class='c012'>I never understood how all the people managed to
hide themselves in so few houses. Turks, we all know,
can perform miracles with mattresses and divans; but
even their ingenuity can seldom have overcome so
“tough a problem” as the inhabitants, official and
civil, of Angora.</p>

<p class='c012'>There <i>is</i>, admittedly, a housing “problem,” and
building has not yet begun. As Angora is to be the
permanent seat of Government, they cannot much
longer delay the important consideration of providing
for Foreign Embassies.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have already driven many times past the Assembly
(which closely resembles one of our county clubs);
I have seen the admirably-arranged flower-gardens
and heard the band. To-morrow, for the first time,
I am to <i>enter</i> the Nationalist Parliament!</p>

<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>ANGORA III.—THE MARVELLOUS ATMOSPHERE OF A GREAT BIRTH</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>In</span> all my wanderings, East and West, over Europe and
America, I have nowhere been so much thrilled by a
dominating sense of “real effort” as at Angora.
Against a background of prehistoric civilisations,
the human bees swarm in and out of their Parliament,
buzzing away night and day, a <i>free and independent
Turkey</i>.</p>
<p class='c012'>What will their “delegation” accomplish at
Lausanne? Is the war only postponed, or will there
be peace? “At one moment our spirits rise to the most
daring hopes; we see ourselves marching into Constantinople.
At the next, Younous Nadi Bey reports
‘grave news’ from abroad, and preparations for war
are resumed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The colonel persists in “doubt” towards England.
“Do you know,” said I, “I am astonished at my own
superiority?”</p>

<p class='c012'>He was not convinced, but demanded chapter and
verse.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We both love Turkey; but I also love your
country and you dislike mine. Therefore, am I not
immensely your superior?”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>In a sense, no doubt, we exaggerate things away
here in Angora. If Europe could ever realise what
“a free and independent Turkey” really means to her
own people, the miracle would still seem no more
than one tiny step forward in the interests of the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Yet sometimes I wonder over the words of Cardinal
Gasparri: “Turkey has not only dictated to England,
but to France and Italy as well.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And now, here in Angora, I see them coming along
their one wide road. All mingled without a thought
of social distinctions; all intent upon the same goal—their
country’s freedom; all alike proud of the price
they have paid—officers and deputies, ministers and
civil servants, soldiers, peasants, and caravan-drivers.
Are not these, then, the one true democracy of the
world?</p>

<p class='c012'>“If I resent being called American,” I told my
friends here, “it certainly is <i>not</i> because I dislike
democracy. In Western practice, alas, it has been
like ‘freedom for women’—so imperfectly carried
out.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>From its original bungalow design, the building of
the Grand Nationalist Assembly still retains a certain
resemblance to the club-pavilion. But considerable
extensions are being put forward as rapidly as a climate
that only varies from ten to fifteen degrees below
zero will permit; while its commanding position, and
the care bestowed upon the entrance and grounds, are
admirably calculated to uphold the honour and dignity
of the Nationalist flag overhead.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a large ante-room on the left as you enter,
where I generally spent a good part of the day, after
my first visit to the Assembly, occasionally finding my
way into the actual Debate. There were always coffee
and cigarettes in the ante-room; and it was there I
met practically all the ministers and deputies, who must,
at last, have grown weary of my endless questions
on every conceivable aspect of their ideals and their
activities. “You must accept me,” I said, in half-serious
apology, “as a self-constituted Father Confessor”
to the new nation he loves and admires so
much.</p>

<p class='c012'>Across the corridor, too, I was allowed sometimes
to say “good afternoon” over a cup of coffee to “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Pasha” (as M. Kemal is here known to all) in his
Presidential Bureau.</p>

<p class='c012'>Honestly, I believe the men “understood” all
my questions, however indiscreet, and did not take
offence. They seemed so eager for me to meet <i>everyone</i>
and learn <i>everything</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was, indeed, a very pleasant and most human
pursuit of knowledge—a continual succession of brilliant
and zealous men, interpreting themselves and their
dreams to an eager listener.</p>

<p class='c012'>Among other matters, I was particularly anxious
to know whether Constantinople or Angora was to be the
<i>permanent</i> capital of the new State, and to understand
all the reasons that would determine their choice.</p>

<p class='c012'>I love every inch of Constantinople. There are
obvious and important religious-historical associations
with its mosques and its public buildings; comfort
and dignity, space and beauty, are, as it were,
already at hand. Yet, paradoxical as it may seem,
to me it lacks, and will always lack, the marvellous
atmosphere of a Great Birth that so impresses one
in Angora.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Turks, I found, were unanimous in having a
similar preference and, naturally, put forward more
precise and practical reasons for their choice. There
may be occasion for a <i>temporary</i> sojourn in Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>But</i> they want an “Asiatic” capital; they want
to govern their own country beyond the reach of
possible interference from dreadnoughts; they want
to maintain an intimate continuity of association with
the cradle of the movement that begot the State.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is, moreover, a primitive and Asiatic charm
in Angora, which should serve, as it were, to “keep
them holy” from the materialisms and the intrigues
of Western commerce-Empires.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here we are all brothers, fellow-labourers in a
common cause. All have suffered—at Malta, in Egypt,
or from corrupt Ottoman Imperial Government.
Could such union and natural intimacy exist elsewhere?</p>

<p class='c012'>The “Brotherhood” of the East does not mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>anything like our various forms of socialism. The
“democracy” or almost complete ignoring of class
distinctions, does not destroy, or even modify, the
inherited respectful submission of illiterate peasants
to their “superiors” in intellect, authority, or military
power. Their religion teaches them to obey.</p>

<p class='c012'>It <i>does</i> mean a universal recognition of identity of
interest; that the “good of all” is every man’s good
and every man’s responsibility; that all have <i>equal</i>
rights to know what can be done for them by the State,
to give their opinions, to express their wishes or their
complaints, and to be heard with courteous attention.
You feel that literally the whole nation is being busy
about its welfare and its hopes.</p>

<p class='c012'>With us, of course, the submerged proletariat
could not practise (and would not be <i>allowed</i> to practise)
such <i>real</i> equality without perpetual self-assertion and
loud outcries against the “slavery” of the past.</p>

<p class='c012'>Every Turk, in his degree, has always been content
with so little. His personal nature is uncomplaining,
from a combination of fine feeling and what
in us would mean lack of courage. Herein lies at once
their great weakness and their great strength.</p>

<p class='c012'>Even the “new,” <i>soi-disant</i> “arrogant” Turk
does not complain. He may intend to, he may assure
us that he will. Western friends, no doubt, are often
tempted to wish him the master of a little more push
and noise. Longer intimacy and a more sympathetic
understanding, however, will cure us of this mistake.
Were he not so supersensitive all the time, did he
attempt our rush methods of progress, he would
soon cease to be himself and lose the fine mystic
idealism for which no sacrifice has been too great, no
passion of waiting and working too prolonged.</p>

<p class='c012'>They will not yet set up a Republic, as we understand
the word. No nation on earth has less capacity
or inclination for Bolshevism. There could never be
any common chord between their faith and the
principles of Lenin and Trotsky. One hears so much
of the Red influence behind Nationalist demands
that it is well to meet these men in their own houses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>(truly “in labour” for a Nation’s birth) to see and
know that such accusations are absolutely false.
Soviet Russia has been a “friend in need” to the
Turks, and may befriend them again; but—<i>nothing
more</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>The overpowering magnificence of the Bolshevik
Embassy may be a measure of their designs, but carries
no proof of achievement. When personages like
Fethi Bey and Rauf Bey are working in tiny offices
no better than glorified barns, one does not, of course,
like to see the Soviets in possession of the only large
and well-appointed building in the town. There is a
staff of seventy, including an army of typists. The
attachés are well supplied with cars, carriages, and
other Western luxuries, paying their bills with gold
Russian roubles.</p>

<p class='c012'>They are allowed to distribute Red literature,
though no one in Turkey thinks of reading it. When
the Russians once sent a few Turks to Angora to preach
Bolshevism, they were promptly shot by the Nationalist
Government, <i>pour encourager les autres</i>! That was
the end of Bolshevist propaganda!</p>

<p class='c012'>I asked one of the deputies what Turkey thought
she had gained from the Bolshevists. “When any
foreign representative visits a country as friendless as
Turkey,” he replied, “and says: ‘We thoroughly
approve of all your ideas and principles; we want to
show the world that we believe in the doctrines of
freedom and independence that you are preaching,’
should we turn away from the only sympathy we
received?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Besides, we had many frontiers to defend;
at least by shaking hands with the Soviet we secured
<i>one</i> frontier. I know that this simple act of grateful
friendship has been much discussed and severely
criticised in Europe. It may have done us great harm;
but beggars cannot be choosers. Who else stretched
out a hand of friendship?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And gold and arms?” I inquired. “Forgive
my indiscretion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A very little gold,” he replied, “not a penny more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>than two million Turkish pounds. We had arms
from all nations, no more from Russia than from
Czecho-Slovakia. It will surprise you to know that
most of them were bought from England and Greece.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But where could you get the money?” I next
inquired.</p>

<p class='c012'>“From our Anatolian population. In no other
country, would the people have accepted such
heavy taxation upon their lands, their cattle, and their
corn. No other country has been driven to resist the
whole world in defence of her very existence. Our
taxes must have reached 75 per cent. So you see
that if Europe does not care to help us, we can manage
for ourselves, and waste no tears over her in difference.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Certain European papers have published a report
that Camerad Areloff has been admitted to the Cabinet
Councils of New Turkey. When an Ambassador from
Angora was asked why her Government did not contradict
the obvious falsehood, he retorted: “If any paper,
in any country, announced that your British Ambassador
was taking part in the Councils of the French
Cabinet, would your Government protest?” It was
readily acknowledged that we should consider such a
statement to be entirely beneath our notice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course you would,” said the Turk; “and we
take precisely the same view.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>When I arrived at the Assembly one afternoon
the band was playing in the gardens—a strange accompaniment,
I thought, to the serious business of Parliament.
I asked one of the deputies whether this
was a national holiday, or a day of thanksgiving for
the arrival of the ex-Khalif at Malta? It was lucky
for me that the rather dangerous little joke only raised
a smile, while he explained that, as the Imperial Band
had fled from Constantinople with the Nationalists,
its loyalty must be acknowledged and its services
utilised. It did, in fact, play here for a short time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>every day. Now I remembered that I had heard bands
also in Smyrna and Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was graciously suggested that I should choose
something myself for the band to play, and I asked that
we might have some Turkish music. One of the
deputies, it appeared, had written an opera; and
after listening with great pleasure to some selections
from his work, I was introduced to the composer.
The opera, naturally written round the cause, is full
of a pathos that brings tears to the eyes of an
understanding audience. They also gave me a patriotic
love song—the reunion of two lovers (Anatolia and
Roumelia) after long years of separation—which I
should like to have heard again and brought away with
me. Its beauty was haunting, though not quite easy
to follow at a first hearing.</p>

<p class='c012'>For Roumelia, we know, her share in the horrors of
war is over. Now it is Anatolia who must suffer.
Trouble was even fomented among the tribes. First,
the rebellion of the Roums, who were encouraged to
stand for private independence; then the hostility of
the Alewites, and the rebellion of Armenians in Cilicia;
finally a rising of Circassian tribes—Durdje, Khandeke,
Adabazar. Naturally again, the men to whom Abdul
Medjid had given the villayet of Sivas, after the horrible
massacres of 1864, were loyal to the Khalif’s successor
and furious at any idea of Nationalist interference.</p>

<p class='c012'>The course of true love between these two nations
had not run smoothly. No wonder their reunion
should be celebrated with such appealing remorse!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The President of the Assembly, Mustapha Kemal
Pasha, was talking to me one day of the French
Revolution, and compared what he called his own “very
elegant” beginning with the poor little Assembly in
which Michelet had to work, with its single table and
just a couple of chairs!</p>

<p class='c012'>Here, in addition to the large ante-room and M.
Kemal’s bureau, the Vice-President, Adnan Bey,
husband of Halidé Edib Hanoum—has his bureau;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>and the actual Assembly Hall (built for concerts) is a
fine room, with its Strangers’ and Press Galleries, its
platform, and Speaker’s desk.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Speaker (in this case the Vice-President)
appeared to me to be ringing his bell for order all
the time; but the whole scene recalls the French
Chamber of Deputies, and here, too, they all talk at
once and interrupt each other without ceremony.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I mentioned to “the Pasha” how strange it
seemed to me that a Parliament should be so noisy,
Fethi Bey explained by describing to his chief the
dignity of our proceedings at Westminster.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a> He proved,
once more, to be a keen observer, quick to decide and
act, though a man of few words. His cold reception
in London did not diminish his keen interest in
our civilisation, which appeals to him immensely, and
which he was always ready to praise. He told me he
wanted to go back to England, this time incognito,
and really master all the institutions, activities, and
policies of the country, in order to explain us to his
own people.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fortunately he saw us on our best behaviour at Westminster.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c012'>I only wish that he could make time for such a
mission. The interfering propaganda of Europe has
made Turkish nationalism very touchy. One
certainly cannot blame them for any suspicion or
readiness to take offence, nor wonder at the reception
they might accord to offers of help from even the
best foreign specialists whom they had not themselves
elected to invite or consult. The fight for freedom
has been single-handed, and the price too heavy for
them to endure a thought of taking the slightest risk.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I noticed one more evidence of Democracy in this
Hall of Assembly. There is absolutely no formal
division, either by rank or office, in the seating accommodation.
The deputies sit anywhere, each at a sort
of school-desk, and when the President comes in to hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>a debate, he simply looks round for the first vacant
seat.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is, however, a tribune for speeches in front
of the Speaker’s table, from which I enjoyed much
fluent and animated oratory. The Turks speak mostly
without notes and their constant gestures recall the
French. Others, however, no doubt partly from my
not knowing the language, produced a similar impression
to that of prayers in a Jewish synagogue.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Assembly is never closed, each member,
however, being entitled to three months’ holiday.
At this time about two hundred were in attendance
and crowded the hall to overflowing. The total
membership is three hundred and forty.</p>

<p class='c012'>I am not allowed to forget that it was England who
really created the Nationalist Assembly—May 16,
1920, is the historic date—when we took possession of
the Turkish Parliament in Constantinople, and the
patriots (a hundred and fifty of the most enlightened
Turks) were imprisoned at Malta. Then it was that
Nationalism demanded, and set up, its own Assembly.</p>

<p class='c012'>Men from Malta and the other deputies who escaped
from Constantinople form two-thirds of the present
Parliament; the remaining third have been elected
in the country itself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Its composition is, indeed, unique, representing
all sorts and conditions of men, as varied in age, social
position, and dress as they are in ideas.</p>

<p class='c012'>As I looked down from the gallery on this strange,
eager group, my eye was caught by the picturesque
figure of that “ancient of days,” the Deputy for
Dersim. Diab is a Kurd, ninety years old, who speaks
Turkish with difficulty. A tall, erect old man, with a
long white beard and large piercing blue eyes that need
no aid from glasses; he wears the tribal head-dress and
robes, carrying an amber chaplet. Though the only
deputy who can neither read nor write, he is a great
personage in his own country, the chief of an important
tribe. As, however, he has only twice spoken in the
Assembly, we may suppose that the mountain population
are generally able to settle their own grievances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>outside Angora. He tells me that, like most of his
constituents, he lives almost entirely upon goats’ milk
and bread, and that, as many of them have reached
their hundred and twentieth year, he himself is reckoned
a young man!</p>

<p class='c012'>Curiously enough, however, it is the Dancing Dervishes
who have sent up one of the most progressive
spirits to the Assembly. The “Grand Tchelebi,” too,
is a picturesque figure in his long brown cylinder felt
hat and ecclesiastical robes. Descended from an
even older family than Osman’s, he yet voted with the
Hodjas for the dethronement of the ex-Khalif.</p>

<p class='c012'>The hostility of many deputies towards the Hodjas
is rather puzzling; but the journalist who said, “These
men cannot think as we think,” may be right. He
added: “Every big nation except the English has recognised
the wisdom of separating Church and State.
Yet when we advocate the same policy we are severely
censured.” It is also stated that the Hodjas themselves
cannot keep pace with the most progressive
among the leaders, and are, therefore, quite willing to
stand outside the Councils of the State. The Assembly
no doubt would not suffer any religious element to
hamper progress or interfere with its newly acquired
freedom and independence.</p>

<p class='c012'>The predominance of military uniforms will strike
any Western observer; but one should remember the
country is still at war. A few still wear the fez;
but the very great majority have adopted the more
picturesque kalpak, that varies in colour from grey
and brown to black, and must be comfortable and warm
in winter.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are, naturally, many of the special difficulties
in this Assembly that are inseparable from all
beginnings of progress, in a country with no experience
of self-government. The more illiterate
deputies, for example, know nothing of Europe, and
regard everything Western with bitter hostility and
distrust. On the other hand, I met one day a brilliant
Socialist munition-worker who, having studied Karl
Marx and Arthur Henderson, wants to establish a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>precise replica of English trade unionism in Turkey—which
God forbid!</p>

<p class='c012'>There are some simple farm labourers, shopkeepers,
lawyers, doctors who have studied in Paris,
newspaper editors, University professors, and Valis.</p>

<p class='c012'>The most enlightened speak practically every
language in Europe, and are thoroughly well acquainted
with public life on the Continent. They stand for the
Freedom of Women, and did their best to make
Halidé Hanoum a member of the Assembly. They
would be perfectly at home in our most exclusive
drawing-rooms; yet they work well, in the Cabinet
itself, with men absolutely ignorant of any country
except their own. “Social, or class, differences,” I
am told, “have no place in any Parliament. They
are created by Society women outside!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>During the Conference at Lausanne, the papers
published a scandalous statement that “a deputy
could purchase a seat in the Assembly for ten gold
Turkish pounds!” As a matter of fact, all Turkish
elections are very carefully controlled by inspectors
and the municipal authorities. No one who knows
anything of M. Kemal and his colleagues would dream
of imagining that this form of bribery or purchase
could be allowed.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Smarting under the policy of Malta (not unlike
that of Daudet’s hero, who locked his goat in a room
but forgot to close the window), the Grand “<i>National</i>”
Assembly lives up to its name, and is, above all, anti-everything
that could interfere with real freedom. For
three and a half years of untold hardship and self-sacrifice
the gospel of Nationalism has schooled the
people. It is their religion to-day, from the “Pasha”
himself to the humblest shepherd of the hills.</p>

<p class='c012'>At Angora we read the papers and talk politics
all day; at night we dream of the National Pact.
Everyone watches for foreign telegrams; we all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>attend the Assembly; the statesmen work without
ceasing through the twenty-four hours. The genius
of M. Kemal as military chief and civil organiser is
unequalled.</p>

<p class='c012'>Why, then, do the nations doubt? Turks to-day
are fully determined to run their own country;
they will find the necessary ability and will suffer no
interference. Europe has so far condemned them
unheard and refused them a square deal. We must
change all that and see to it that the East may have
her chance!</p>

<p class='c012'>The more closely I have studied the National
Assembly the greater confidence I feel.</p>

    <div>THE GHAZI MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA—THE GREATEST MAN IN TURKEY TO-DAY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Now</span> that I know Angora, I must know also its
Nationalist hero.</p>
<p class='c012'>Fethi Bey has invited me this afternoon to meet
the President at the Assembly. The Lausanne Conference
is beginning—perhaps he will give me his
impressions.</p>

<p class='c012'>From the window of the antechamber I saw the
Pasha arrive, attended only by one aide-de-camp.
There is, of course, absolutely no foundation for the
stories that he is even more strictly guarded than
Lenin, among a people who trust and love him!</p>

<p class='c012'>It is not necessary to see M. Kemal Pasha to realise
that he is the greatest man in Turkey to-day, quite
apart from his actual achievements. He has, indeed,
accomplished miracles; but it is rather the universal
attitude of the people by which one measures the man.
I feel that my host’s regard for me was definitely
increased when I had had lunch with Mustapha Kemal.
The servants announce the “Pasha, Pasha”—no need
for a more precise name.</p>

<p class='c012'>Should one hold him greater as statesman, soldier,
or orator? since he is past-master in all three aspects.
Personally, I am more grateful to him who prevents
war than to the conqueror. It is as a statesman that I
met him, and I will therefore first consider his political
ideals and work.</p>

<p class='c012'>Great events create great men, and it is but once
in the life of a nation that situations so grave as that
which found Mustapha Kemal are ever likely to arise.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>He rose out of the terror of the Hamidian régime, the
years that followed, and the humiliation of <i>occupied</i>
Smyrna. It needed, however, the suffering and sorrow
to which all reformers must serve their apprenticeship
to mould his character and to bring him where he
now stands. It was the long-suffering martyrdom one
saw in the face of his late mother that forced him to
realise what he must do, and he has never faltered
from the goal.</p>

<p class='c012'>Only here, beside them, can one understand all the
Government has had to do in Angora, and see for oneself
how the whole flock still look to this one man for
courage and inspiration. Had <i>he</i> lost faith in the goal
or in his capacity to reach it, all would have been lost.
“Freedom for Turkey or death for the Turks” has
been his motto throughout the years.</p>

<p class='c012'>I suppose that, however often one may proclaim
it, they will not believe who have not seen, a new
Turkey is born into the world. It is, indeed, idle to
weep over the days that are dead and gone, when the
Turk counted for nothing in his own land; when the
foreigner ruled the roost, and ambassadors were
princes! The new Turk has arrived; the member
of a new nation. No important demand was made
at Lausanne by Turkey that any self-respecting people
could be asked to forgo.</p>

<p class='c012'>And yet the Powers are still attempting to treat
with “old” Turkey! We have no longer to maintain
our officious, if well-meant, interference on behalf
of disloyal minorities; to insist, <i>par exemple</i>, that
Christians shall be exempted from military service,
as America never exempted her negro
population.</p>

<div id='i160'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE GHAZI MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA.<br /><span class='sc'>President of the Grand National Assembly, Angora.</span><br />(Signed portrait presented to the Author).<br />p. 160</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>No wonder, again, M. Kemal has been more than
tempted to wish (what, for no other reason, he could
desire) to abolish religion altogether, after the imposition
upon Constantinople of that arch-intriguer
the Greek Patriarch! When France and Italy
recognised the “State” Church for the parasite that
may, at any moment, suck up its life-blood, they cast
the Church aside. Confronted at the very outset by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>a precisely similar danger, Mustapha Kemal at once
cut off the Khalifat from the Assembly and considerably
limited the power of the Hodjas, a far more difficult
operation than French disestablishment. Yet we
expect him a second time to expose himself to the
intrigues of a Greek Patriarch!</p>

<p class='c012'>He is, as a fact, far more leniently inclined towards
the Greeks and Armenians than any other Turkish
statesman. He sees even their wanton destruction of
Anatolia as no more than the outburst of a misguided
people, the victims of bigger, intriguing Powers. He
would rather welcome their return to loyalty than
give their place in commerce to the Jews, from the
humane conviction that they have no homes outside
Turkey.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The home life of Mustapha Kemal, literally given
to his country, involves severe daily self-sacrifice.
From month to month he allows himself no recreation,
no change of scene, no intercourse with the world’s
culture. Among these lonely mountains he cannot
break the monotony by going to a play or to a concert;
he does not hunt or follow any kind of sport; and even
Nature, at least in winter, is scarcely kind.</p>

<p class='c012'>His life is one of continual mental and physical
effort: reading, studying, and planning, seeing
everyone, for they all want to see “The Pasha” and
not the second in command. To me he seems like
a professor, who must be forever explaining to his
people what their Nationalism really means. Perhaps
the nearest historical parallel to his abounding
personality is that of Julius Cæsar; and one is
tempted to hope that he, too, may find time to
leave us the “Commentaries.” The world would
know how to value what the Turks need put on
record, the thought of this keen and alert mind
which is able to interpret, if not supplement, the
Koran for modern conditions and aspirations. They
have, as it were, many centuries of progress to catch
up; and, fortunately, he is no blind respecter of
<i>tyrannical</i> religious or historic traditions that hamper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>advance to freedom. A commentary of great value
could be compiled from his thoughtful and stirring
speeches.</p>

<p class='c012'>It may be that, as in art the highest form is simplest,
we shall, after all, see the perfect Democracy in the
East. The ideals of President Wilson have been discarded
as impossible; Russia has signally failed
to carry out the teachings of Karl Marx. Mustapha
Kemal Pasha, at least, has put <i>his</i> doctrine in practice
to the acknowledged advantage of a country in the
“Slough of Despond.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Turkish statesmen maintain to-day that any form
of a Second Chamber remains only the unfit survival
of decadent Monarchies and Empires, that the
Single Chamber is the most perfect machine for
Government, avoiding friction and delay.</p>

<p class='c012'>Time alone can prove!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>At my first interview with “The Pasha” he was wearing
a big astrakhan kalpak, pushed well down over his
forehead, and smoking cigarette after cigarette.
Though busy receiving ministers and deputies in the
Presidential Bureau, he was at the same time waiting,
as it were, for the right moment to sum up the
whole situation in one final and decisive reply that
could not fail to end all discussion. This power to
drive right through a subject, to find the way out
and take it, is one of the chief sources of his unique
authority.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was ready, however, for a sociable cup of coffee,
and immediately asked for news of England. Fethi
Bey reminded him of a few scenes from life to which
I had introduced him in London, including dinner at
a Ladies’ Club. Most women would admire the
picturesquely weatherbeaten tint of the Pasha’s
complexion, though the piercing, almost stern, glance
of the eye should remind you that you will do well to
say clearly and quietly what you have to say—and go!
Though so businesslike and energetic, he has a beautifully
modulated voice. His French is well-chosen; in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Turkish he is an orator. Here, then, are the face and
the expression of a conqueror, but the voice is the voice
of a cultured man of the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next morning Mustapha Kemal sent his car (a
present from the people of Smyrna) that I might be
driven to his villa at Tchan-Kaya, almost twenty
minutes’ ride from Angora. This is the best road in the
district; the others are just rows of holes and bumps
on which someone has thrown some cobbles and, incidentally,
some houses! Though Tchan-Kaya was given
to him by the people, he has handed over this property
to the army, and lives there as their guest—surely an
unusual, but charming, example of brotherly love. I
wonder whether the Pasha will do the same in the
house I saw, also presented to him, at Broussa, which an
historian and architect came over from Constantinople
to redecorate.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Tchan-Kaya one obtains an excellent bird’s-eye
view of Angora; whether at midday or at sunset,
sprinkled with, or buried in, snow, always picturesque.
We get a few hours of sunshine every morning until
quite late in the year; enough to welcome the beautiful
white minarets, so marked a feature in every Eastern
scene, whence the muezzin calls the faithful to
prayer five times a day. Dotted over the hills of
Tchan-Kaya we see the Pasha’s special guard—the
Lasz—wearing a uniform our ladies would be
delighted, I think, to copy in velvet or satin. The
fashion, however, would only suit those who, like these
soldiers from Trébizonde, are tall, slight, and well-built.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the door one gladly accepts the vociferous greeting
of a fine brown retriever. Then comes the aide-de-camp,
Mahmoud Bey, always ready with a gay smile
for his chief’s guests, who leads one straight into the
house.</p>

<p class='c012'>The kiosk is large and well-built. In the
combination of hall and ante-room a white marble
fountain is always playing. One of the two pianos in
Angora stands in a corner; these are both, alas,
more ornamental than useful, made, one could guess,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>somewhere about 55 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>! A large desk, some fine
plants, and the usual Turkish or Persian rugs complete
the furniture. One door leads into the Pasha’s mother’s
apartments, the other to his own sitting-room.</p>

<div id='i164'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i164.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>On the wall of Mustapha Kemal Pasha’s study the Sultan Osman, first of the House of Osman, looks down on Mustapha Kemal Pasha, who has ended the dynasty.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>I could scarcely believe that I was speaking to the
legislator, as my host rose to greet me from his Western
red-leather sofa. Without his kalpak, his fair
hair, well brushed back, his close-cropped moustache,
his well-tailored clothes with the correct crease, would
surely carry him through a London drawing-room
without a guess that he was not English, or, at any
rate, not from the North. Again, his keen sense of
humour is not common among the Turks, and it was a
delight to find how heartily he joined in the laugh which
his delightful stories provoked.</p>

<p class='c012'>I am told that the Pasha’s type and colouring are not
uncommon in his native Roumelia—as ever, the
North is fair!</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Noticing some “Napoleon” literature on one of
the writing-tables, I regretted that “I had not thought
of bringing a book about the ‘little Corsican,’ instead
of merely offering my congratulations on a magnificent
victory.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please never think of such a thing,” he replied.
“He interests me as a great general, but——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I understood your interest amounted almost to
veneration, or so it is said.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a strange rumour! I naturally study all the
great strategists; but to compare the Sakharia with
Austerlitz is surely no great compliment.”</p>

<div id='i165'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i165.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Ante-room at Tchan-Kaya.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Though I confess to being considerably startled
by this emphatic declaration, it reminded me of a
conversation with Monsieur Clemenceau some years
before the war.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He told me,” I said, “that he considered Lord
Rosebery’s enthusiastic admiration of Napoleon had
been almost a blot on his own political career....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>‘Where is the greatness of that vain egoist?’ asked
the outspoken Frenchman. ‘I consider myself a
hundred times greater, for this simple reason:
When Napoleon came down he fell for ever. When I,
or my country, are down, then I am at my greatest
and best.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>Though M. Kemal could smile at the Gallic boasting,
while honouring the boaster, his own criticism was more
quietly expressed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Napoleon put ambition first. He fought for
himself, <i>not</i> for ‘the Cause’—with the inevitable
<i>débâcle</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As I listen to Mustapha Kemal, taking advantage
the while of his gracious invitation to thaw my frozen
toes and hands at the wood fire, I wonder what a “keen
soldier” would not have given to be in my place,
with the chance of hearing a private lecture from one
of the world’s great generals, a man not more than
forty.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Were you ever in doubt of success?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, never,” he replied. “I saw the whole scheme
from the first (even when we had no munitions), just
as it finally worked out. We delayed—to save bloodshed
and devastation. Fethi Bey went to London as
a last resource, because we wanted a treaty—in ink,
not in blood.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Is not that last effort for peace, perhaps, this great
man’s finest gesture to a war-ridden generation?
Knowing the glory he could win for himself, in the
certainty of strength for conquest, he yet made three
separate attempts to persuade the Powers to enforce
a peaceful retirement upon the Greeks. Preparation
is not relaxed; no detail has been forgotten; the
peasant armies are ready in Anatolia, wondering
why, since peace lingers, the Great Chief does not
fight!</p>

<p class='c012'>One of his generals told me later: “You cannot
judge “The Pasha” until you have seen him commanding
his army. No man could be more fearless, more hard
on himself, or kinder to his men. He simply ignores
pain, though a rib be driven into his lungs; and when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>he leads them, the soldiers know all is well. ‘His
star is good,’ they say, and they have no use for
generals in the East for whom the stars are known to
predict ill. His mind works rapidly to clear decisions.
Above all, he never loses his head, and his judgment is
sound.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Without this universal, unstinting affection and
esteem from both officers and men, Mustapha Kemal
could never have established the Assembly and created
a new Turkey. When he had thus realised the vision
of his ardent youth, that never left him through years of
exile, revolt, and disgrace; when, at any moment now,
he could declare himself Dictator, he will not steal
responsibility from the people’s representatives.
“The Assembly,” he says, “is not one man; I am only
its President.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He dislikes hearing the word “Kemalist.” “It
does not carry with it the spirit of the movement,
which will go on, whether I am dead or alive.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If one speaks to him about his own work, he either
answers: “I did my duty,” or refers all honour to
the Assembly.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have talked with many of Europe’s great statesmen,
but found none more modest than he. Yet who
among them has snatched such triumph from odds
as opposing?</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The furniture of this little room is, of course, all
“native.” The dinner-service comes from Kutahia,
the carpets and rugs are Anatolian. On the walls
hang jewelled swords and other trophies or souvenirs,
sent in homage from Moslem rulers to the conqueror
they all acknowledge. He may endeavour to efface
himself, to glory in his simplicity and set up a real
democracy; but the stamp of his personality is
on the whole Moslem world; he holds in his hand the
keys of Islam. Nationalism has now acquired a
deep religious significance; the Pact is a “decalogue”
none may deny.</p>

<p class='c012'>A well-known Turkish writer has boldly compared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the movement with Christianity; humbly born, bringing
suffering to all, death and martyrdom to many—for
an Ideal of the Spirit no human enemy can

<p>Mustapha Kemal Pasha’s Sitting-room.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In Egypt they speak of “Holy Angora,” and,
wherever future assemblies may meet, she will be always
sacred. An Egyptian princess, I notice, uses capitals
when referring to the Ghazi Pasha as “He” or
“Him.” If only the delegates at Lausanne could have
managed to peep behind the scenes at Angora!
If they still considered the Nationalist demands
unreasonable, they could scarcely have failed to
pause before the deep-rooted fanaticism they have
inspired.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The Pasha is nothing if not frank. He has no
time for bluff, though his pride was stung by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>idle boasting of our ex-Premier: “You’ve got to
speak to these people with guns.”</p>

<p class='c012'>No charge could be more ridiculous or untrue than
to say that Mustapha Kemal is ever influenced by
Camerad Areloff. Bolshevism and Nationalism are
poles apart. Yet the Pasha could scarcely refuse
invitations to conversation with any credited representative
from a country like Russia; though no
words of his are likely to change M. Kemal’s
invariable habit of using his <i>own</i> judgment and
making up his <i>own</i> mind.</p>

<p class='c012'>Though he seldom speaks without a practical
purpose, I was honoured by an intimacy that nearly
approached that of an old school friend. There were
changes, however, to rather puzzling reserve, almost
frigid politeness, in his case probably not caused by any
reminder of my nationality. He knows not only
whom, but when, to trust, and I suppose I had unwittingly
opened some dangerous topic.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>One almost wishes at times that he need not live
so perpetually in the heat of the fray. Driven,
perhaps, by greater intelligence or stricter integrity,
to some unpopular action, he might lose his halo,
or at least dim its lustre, while the new country
was still too unstable for any weakening of his guiding
hand. There are fanatical members of the Assembly
who, <i>bien entendu</i>, are far more extreme than he,
whose unchecked counsels might spell disaster. I
sought, indeed, for the opposition within of which
we have heard so much, and found only a very small
group of rather small-minded men, at present with little
power.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, foolish measures, that might prove
a real menace, and were certainly false to true freedom,
have been put forward and discussed. The schemes
for excluding Albanians and Arabs from the Assembly,
and for requiring five years’ residence in one place, hit
“The Pasha” himself. Telegrams of angry protest came
in from all quarters, and he soon stopped the mischief.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Others, however, may prove more difficult. The opposition
seem to me seeking in Nationalism—“<i>midi à 14
heures</i>,” as the French say.</p>

<p class='c012'>At present he is not only adored by those who trust
him and gave up all to follow him, but respected and
admired by those recently serving the Sultan, who had
not the courage to believe that right must triumph
and truth prevail.</p>

<p class='c012'>I believe that his personality could always dominate
the Assembly at Angora, and there is unquestionably
no possible foundation for the reported rivalry of
Kiazim Kara Békir. They are the best of friends, each
conspicuously loyal to the other, and Kiazim Kara
Békir is far too proud of his leader to want his
place.</p>

<p class='c012'>I foresee, however, that even his clearest instructions
may sometimes be badly interpreted, and thus
bring blame for what he has not done and never
intended. There will be difficulties again in certain
foreign relations, because the most loyal Nationalists,
for whom justice and gratitude alike demand reward,
will not all be so well fitted as the existing diplomats
for the embassies of Europe.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Though no one could have suspected it from his
manner, I learnt that my Angora host had been seriously
alarmed at the prospect of receiving an Englishwoman
into his household. His first impressions,
however, were unexpectedly in my favour. And the
ladies agreed: “You are just like our Pasha—fair
hair and blue eyes. You might be his sister.” It was
the highest possible compliment, the best possible
passport.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mustapha Kemal found time to be no less hospitable,
and often treated me to a concert of Anatolian
songs with the oute (or stringed guitar) accompaniment.
It was at his house I first tasted the most delicious of
Turkish confections, “<i>poulet à la Circassienne</i>,” that is
chicken with nut sauce. It was frequently offered to me
after that; but, alas, like all things Turkish, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>their “light” pastry <i>Bereks</i>, it is as fattening as it is
appetising.</p>

<p class='c012'>One afternoon “the Pasha” joined us to pay visits
to the houses surrounding his kiosk. We made
a strange party: the Ghazi Pasha and his aide-de-camp,
the Englishwoman, and a big white ram!
The magnificent goats of Anatolia follow one about
and welcome caresses such as we lavish on a pet
dog. The Armenians weave handsome shawls from
their silky hair. Angora is also famous for its cats
and its rabbits.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Mustapha Kemal Pasha Walking in the Grounds of Tchan-Kaya.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Naturally, the “veiled” tenants stood in too great
awe of their Pasha to say much, so we first walked on
to inspect the new family of a favourite dog, then
visited another happy family of geese and chickens
and the horses! Like many Orientals, M. Kemal is
over-merciful to his beasts, who are apt to grow fat and
lazy from insufficient exercise.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Mustapha Kemal always says, and means, that
everyone has a right to come and see him. He
enjoys talking with peasants, and pays a generous
tribute to their sterling worth. But in Turkey,
some mysterious inborn tact prevents the uncultured
from awkward attempts at intrusion upon his
superior, however brotherly the hand of friendship
between them. It is, however, almost impossible
to compare the two countries, for, despite the Moslem’s
respect for authority in every shape or form, rank
and family do <i>not</i> count with him as with us, and the
feudal habits, of which no so-called democracy can
cure us, must appear strange indeed to these simple
folk.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I have been privileged to hear “the Pasha” explaining
the new Turkey he has created, expressing
all his ideas, hopes, fears and anxieties; and this,
at what is perhaps the very summit of his career, when
his nation has just entered upon her existence of
freedom and independence.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet I hesitate before the attempt to analyse or to
describe the character and political achievement of
this man; to convey all the subtlety and the strength
of his mind. The complexities, and the apparent
contradictions, of the Oriental are always baffling
to the West; while, though far superior to vanity, the
Pasha knows his own value and takes himself, as it
were, too much for granted, to encourage or assist
others in the dissection of his character. I can but
rest on the tolerance all great men extend to our
judgments, if prompted by sincerity and justice and
a love of truth. As it is written in the proverbs of old
Japan: “If your judgments are tempered by the
dictates of truth, the gods will protect you, even though
you offer no prayers to them.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>We are naturally enthusiastic before a New
Turkey, built out of nothing. Surely these people are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>capable of carrying on? If some ask: “Will
this man lose his head?” we answer: “He has not
done so under the strongest temptation. Why should
we fear?... He has not made himself Dictator;
he has refused wealth and honour; he has abolished
‘decorations!’”</p>

<p class='c012'>When the work of reconstruction begins in real
earnest, when the country, so rich in minerals and with
so fertile a soil, can be developed in peace to the best
advantage; then I, for one—now I know him—believe
“The Pasha” will prove to us that he can unite his
people no less wisely in the building up of their
fatherland than in saving it from tyranny and
interference.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Nationalists have had their warning from
mistakes made by the Committee of Union and
Progress, against the only real danger one can reasonably
foresee, that of teaching the people to run before
they have learnt to walk.</p>

<p class='c012'>To all who would see the vision realised of an established,
strong, and well-governed new Turkey, I only
say: “Take care of your Pasha, for ‘his value is
above rubies.’”</p>

    <div>AN INTERVIEW WITH THE GHAZI MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> Ghazi M. Kemal Pasha granted me the following
interview just after the conference at Lausanne had
assembled.</p>
<p class='c012'>“To what extent, if any, has the attitude of the
Grand National Assembly been responsible for setting
public opinion against the Turks?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our attitude has never changed. All reports
of inconsistency are false, and circulated by the clever
propaganda of our enemies. The Government has to
render account of itself not only to a Chamber of
Deputies, but to History; and no responsible or
self-respecting Ministry could act with such disloyalty
to its own principles, the very spirit of its being, as the
Press has accused it of revealing. All these false
reports come from those Englishmen, some of them
official, who are working to prolong the war, a crime
no one can lay on our shoulders. You know of the
untiring efforts we made for peace, and you know the
result. In any case, though personally accused, I am
not responsible. I am only President of the Assembly.
The Assembly is not one man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you think that a really <i>sincere entente</i> can
be established between Turkey and Great Britain?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do not think, I am <i>certain</i>, that we shall eventually
return to the old traditional friendship. There are
no reasons against, and so many in favour of, that
course. We make no demands beyond respect and
honour for our independence. We have sent away our
Sultan to secure greater freedom, and to prevent all
risk of danger to our independence.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“Do you think that the Conference will produce
good results?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Eventually there can be no doubt that, however
heated and however prolonged the discussions, it will
bring peace. Unfortunately, we cannot wait for ever:
The Powers should recognise now, what they must
ultimately admit, that we could not accept terms
which would deny us that liberty for which we have
sacrificed so much and fought with such stern resolve.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For every reason, we desire peace; a settlement
that will enable us to get on with the vital work of
reconstruction. Details must take time, but the
essential question should have been arranged before
this.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The papers accuse Angora of arrogance and
zenophobia,” I reminded him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The charge is invented for propaganda. Is
it <i>arrogant</i> to stand out for our just and logical rights ?
Of ‘zenophobia’ I know nothing! My whole life,
in every action, is proof that I do <i>not</i> hate Europe. I
never fought for hate, but to save the truth. The
same inspiration guides and controls our politics.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I could never myself keep on hating a nation
for the mistakes of its Government. I fought
against the Bulgarians, who are my greatest friends
to-day.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And towards the Greeks I feel the same. I am
confident that we shall soon be great friends, friends
as we were before the Powers intervened. As they
were led away by false flatterers, they will be the first
to see their mistake and repent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have you banished the Christians, or are they
leaving Anatolia in mere panic?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have taken no steps in this matter, but left
them absolutely free, to go or stay. They have
been terrified by propaganda, largely American, directed
by religious animosities. While they followed the
Greek army in thousands, and are still flying, many
others are coming back. To-day you can see two long
streams of refugees among us, one leaving, the other
returning. They know that all Christians, whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>our own subjects or foreigners, will always enjoy, as
they <i>have</i> always enjoyed, the full liberties accorded
them in every civilised country.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are you satisfied with the situation in Constantinople?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We shall keep faith to the promise we made at
Moudania. Meanwhile it is unnatural to see
foreign troops in Constantinople, and they should
be taken away as soon as possible. Their presence
involves abnormal conditions, which have made it
necessary for us to administer that villayet from the
Assembly at Angora—an indignity which should
not be prolonged.</p>

<p class='c012'>“While conversations are maintained in Lausanne,
and since everyone knows we must keep Constantinople,
the Powers should not insist on the armed
guarantee.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you congratulate us on having secured a
Conservative Government?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is early days, surely, to speak! If they will
help us to friendly relations with England and
the other Powers, that is all we ask. Your parties
are not our business. We are, generally speaking,
against all policies of expansion, because they lead
nations into the abyss; and, in our judgment, such
policies are impolitic.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are your views on the Freedom of the
Straits?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Like the delegates at Lausanne, we want <i>real</i>
freedom, not freedom in the hands of one Power.
We are ready to discuss the problem with all who have
any interests in that quarter. There can be no freedom
till Constantinople and the Sea of Marmora are
secure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must have national frontiers; that is, all
territories peopled by Turks. We accept for boundaries
or limit the enemy-lines as they were when the
Armistice was signed. Is that an unreasonable claim
in return for all we have given up from the old
Ottoman Empire?</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Towards ‘minorities’ we stand by the National
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Pact, confirmed by the recent Treaty with France,
signed at Angora. We are fully prepared, nay anxious,
to recognise all such rights as have been given to
minorities in the different treaties between the
Powers—since the war. It must, however, be clearly
understood that foreign control, inconsistent with the
absolute independence we demand, is <i>impossible</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nor can we grant any special privileges for Capitulations
to the subjects of foreign nations who may
choose to live in Turkey. They are welcome to
<i>precisely the same rights</i> as our own subjects enjoy,
but we will never recognise any such privileges to
foreigners as are unknown, for instance, in France,
England, or America. Those who would still challenge
our claim to the complete independence that we are
determined to secure will have to find means to
exterminate all Turks now inspired by that ideal.
But I am confident that such a slaughter would not
be permitted by the civilised world. Civilisation, on
the contrary, will soon learn that our Turkey has
her place in the future. She will help, and not
hinder, civilisation. Civilisation must, therefore, be
interested in, and support, her independence.”</p>

<p class='c012'>On December 22nd, the <i>Morning Post</i> printed the
following leading article about this interview:</p>

<p class='c020'>The interview which Mustapha Kemal Pasha has given our
Correspondent emphasises the one supreme result so far
reached at Lausanne, namely, that the new rulers of Turkey are
willing and indeed anxious to resume friendly relations with this
country. The compromise which is apparently on the point of
being reached at Lausanne concerning the Straits and the demilitarised
zones may not survive the touch of reality and the sharp
breath of war. But that is no reason why we should deplore or
despise such a settlement, for it is at least a sign of goodwill, an
offer on the part of Turkey to come to an agreement with the
Western Powers, who, by the strange irony of fate, are the real
friends of Turkey and yet were forced in the Great War to call
themselves her enemies. The Lausanne Conference has dealt
with and perhaps settled the Thracian boundaries, the protection
of minorities, and the guardianship of the Straits, and there remains
for it now to secure an agreement regarding the capitulations, the
Patriarchate, and the future of Mosul. But the real importance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Lausanne lies in the fact that the world now realises that Kemalist
Turkey is not the cat’s-paw of Bolshevist Russia, that the Turkish
Nationalists did not defeat one invader in order to put themselves
at the mercy of another, and that the ambitious plan of Moscow
for using Turkey as a pawn in the great game of destroying British
dominion in the East is in all probability doomed to failure. It is
too early yet to say that the Bolshevicks have been outwitted, but
both in their silences and their speeches there are evidences of
chagrin. They have found out that Lausanne is not Genoa and
that, if we may thus describe him, Curzon <i>libre</i> is a very different
person from Curzon <i>enchaîné</i>. Chicherin had his Rapallo. Perhaps
it was his final triumph.</p>

<p class='c021'>Kemal, in his interview, said: “I am certain we shall eventually
return to the traditional friendship between Turkey and Britain.
I can see no obstacle thereto.” With the fall of the Coalition
Government, the last obstacle has gone. Lord Curzon has been
firm with the Turks, but not venomous, frank but not insulting.
He can afford to leave rude harangues and offensive imprecations
to the congress of fallen angels now assembling at Algeciras. Indeed,
all the declarations of the Foreign Secretary go to show that
he is sincerely anxious to reach a durable and friendly settlement
with the emissaries of Angora, and that if he is determined to
uphold the rights of the British, he is equally ready to acknowledge
the independence of the Turkish Empire. We are glad to see that
Kemal is anxious to reciprocate, and therein he shows himself to be
not only a soldier but a statesman. For his task is not yet ended;
indeed it is only beginning. He has saved his country from the
Greek; he must now save it from the moth and rust of economic
decay. In that great task he will find Great Britain his best friend.
Fethi Bey has doubtless made it clear to him how much Europe
can contribute to the economic reconstruction of Turkey, and a
recent statement of Mr. Morgenthau should convince him that the
United States will be a reluctant and difficult lender. In the long
run he has to choose between free co-operation with Great Britain
and an enslavement at the mercy of Bolshevist Russia. He seems
already to have chosen the better course; for the sake of his country,
and ours, we hope and believe that he will persist in it.</p>

    <div>MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA—THE MAN WHO IS MASTER OF HIS FATE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>My</span> eye fell on the portrait of a handsome Turkish
lady, which was hanging over the Pasha’s writing-desk.</p>
<p class='c012'>“What a lovely face!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My mother,” said the Pasha, with obvious pride.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Would it be very indiscreet,” said I, “to ask if
I might have the great pleasure of seeing her?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“She is very ill. The doctors are with her day and
night. Alas, I fear she can never recover.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We afterwards went up the staircase to the invalid’s
apartments. To my surprise, we found her seated on
a wide divan, supported by cushions. It was difficult
at first to believe that she was so near the end.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alas!” said Mustapha Kemal, “her suffering
has come through me. She is paying back now the tears
and anguish she spent for me in exile.” There was
sorrow in his voice, too heart-broken for many words.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now you can take part in his victory,” I said.
“How proud you must be of your son. His is a
wonderful story. I am proud only to have spoken with
him and seen his work.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She thanked me with great feeling, and said she
believed “God had sent her this son to save the
Fatherland—but my son is always kind to me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Whilst giving me a beautiful silk handkerchief,
scented with her favourite perfume, she asked whether
she had not seen me before, ten years ago, in Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c012'>“She has a marvellous memory,” the Pasha
murmured.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>In a few days there were to be no more opportunities
for any of us to see this dear lady!</p>

<p class='c012'>When, later, in Constantinople, I ventured upon
some allusion to the great devotion he always evinced
to his mother, a Turk said: “That is only natural—Oriental,
if you will. The man whose hands are
steeped in blood, whose soul is black with crime, yet
bows in respect to his mother. You might as well
be surprised that the sun shines.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The story of M. Kemal’s youth and of his brilliant
career is, of course, well known in Anatolia. He was
born in Salonica in 1880, and there are legends that
many who saw the boy, “fair as the corn,” at his games,
would say: “Look well at that little fellow. He will
one day be the saviour of his country.”</p>

<p class='c012'>St. Jeanne d’Arc’s “Life,” you remember, begins
with a description of the countryside on the night of
her birth—“all the animals seemed strangely excited.
There was a chorus of approval from the chickens, the
geese, and the pigs.” “Very possibly,” as a friend
once commented on this passage, “it all happened
again on the night each of us was born, but no one
noticed it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So I will speak only of facts. A year ago, how
few had even heard his name! How often the Unknown
Personality has appeared, just when hope
seemed dead, to save his country!</p>

<p class='c012'>M. Kemal’s father died when he was quite a child,
though already attending the school of Chemsi Effendi.
Then, for a few years, his mother took him to stay
with an uncle in the country, and life became one
glorious game in the sunny fields, shooting at rooks,
stealing Nature’s secrets, and flourishing on all the
delights of being naughty with no one to interfere.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although his mother seems to have felt, however,
that young minds cannot safely be left long undisciplined,
and, therefore, brought him back to school
at Salonica, the experiment did not prove a success.
Like other unusual boys, he was always in hot water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>and, in the end, was allowed to come home and play
at soldiers.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Edison’s unsympathetic schoolmistress who
told <i>his</i> mother: “This boy’s brain is addled, we can
do nothing with him.” He had given one of his companions
a seidlitz powder to find out whether the gas
would lift up his patient into the air! Mrs. Edison
was wise enough to take the boy’s education into her
own hands, proving herself “the loveliest and most
wonderful teacher on God’s earth,” as he afterwards
declared.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the Pasha’s mother did not approve of soldiering,
the boy simply took himself off to a military
college, passed the examinations with distinction, and
then proudly confronted her with all his certificates!
He was both hard-working and intelligent, devoted to
French and mathematics.</p>

<p class='c012'>But even as a schoolboy his country’s suffering
must have eaten into his ardent imagination. I was
told that he would spend hours of recreation in
making speeches and organising a committee,
to protest against the tyranny of Abdul Hamid.
Already he felt that an army was not enough to save
his country, and persuaded some of his schoolfellows
to study politics, sowing the seed of all he has since
given to the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>From the beginning he determined, above all, to
make himself master of every detail concerning the
French Revolution; to understand, by understanding
“the people,” why it happened and how it happened,
what mistakes were made, the real ideals
that inspired its passion of sacrifice, and the permanent
gains it brought to France and to mankind.</p>

<p class='c012'>Long after all his companions were fast asleep, the
young Mustapha dived into every possible book he
could lay hands on, to clear up this fascinating
subject. Next morning he would hold forth to all
and sundry upon his discoveries, and finally issued
a paper with exemplary regularity, which was widely
circulated in manuscript.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meanwhile military studies had not been neglected;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>He was promoted Staff Captain, and—through under-hand
channels—“recommended” to the notice of
Abdul Hamid, who promptly exiled him to Syria.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Damascus, Beyrout, and Jaffa, his more
revolutionary plans matured. At last the Constitution
was proclaimed, and he was able to join his
mother in Salonica!—not yet, however, for the quiet
of a restored home life.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the time when the troops marched to deliver Constantinople
from the reactionaries, he was appointed
Chief of Staff to Mahmoud Chefket Pasha. During the
Tripolitain War he was first at Syrenaique, and
afterwards at Benghazi.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the Great War broke out, he was military
attaché at Sofia, but was immediately despatched to
the command of a Division in the Dardanelles, and,
when this had been formed and organised, marched
to Gallipoli. It was he who defeated the English
forces, not only in Gallipoli, but at Anafarta.</p>

<p class='c012'>After we had been driven out of the Dardanelles,
he went to the Caucasus in command of the 15th
Army Corps, and recovered Bitlis and Mouche from
the Russians. For a time he led the 6th Army Corps,
under the German General Falkenhayn; but nothing
could reconcile him to his chief’s methods and the
reckless loss of life they involved. He therefore
resigned and went back to Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c012'>After accompanying the present Khalif on a visit
to Hindenberg and Ludendorff, he tells me that, when
he thus first clearly saw into the real issue of the
war; he also saw, even more clearly, the need for making
his own plans in Turkey.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was in Syria when the Armistice was signed;
and returning with high hopes to Constantinople, sank
broken-hearted before the treachery of Mudros! But
not for long.</p>

<p class='c012'>Never the man to nurse despair, he quickly rose
again to his country’s call. Offered the post of
Inspector of the East (that is, High Functionary of the
Eastern Villayets), he accepted at once, and hurried
into Anatolia to prepare for resistance.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>From the moment he stepped out at Samsoun, <i>the
movement began</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>What shall we say of the “Man at the Helm—the
Hero and the Genius?” Were his “Destinies,”
indeed, “written on the tablets of heaven”; or may
he not rather claim:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am Master of my Fate</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c012'>Every detail of the work had to be built up, as it
were, stone by stone, entirely afresh—an army to be
found anywhere and everywhere from nothing.
Yet it was trained and organised to become, what
Colonel Mougin tells me, is “the best-disciplined and
best-officered army in the world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps the Battle of the Sakharia, lasting fifteen
days without interruption, may be quoted as the
Great Victory. It was certainly one of the battles
of this century. When one of the majors asked for
instructions about “the line provided for retreat,” he
was told: “There will be no retreat. Advance, or
die in your trenches!”</p>

<p class='c012'>On the anniversary of the Battle of the In-Enus,
Ismet Pasha told me a little about his victory, and
what it meant. What victory <i>must</i> mean when you
have nothing with which to conquer.</p>

<p class='c012'>Already the military experts have written pages
about the advance and the victory. One day, we hope,
“The Pasha” will give us his own version.</p>

<p class='c012'>How, again, shall we tell the endurance of the
people, suffering through long years in silence and
alone? To us who could but look on them, pitying
and admiring from a distance, it seemed as if someone
<i>must</i> get through somehow to offer the hand of friendship
and give, at least, heartfelt sympathy. I tried,
but it could not be done. Even now, I cannot say
all it has cost me to reach Angora!</p>

<p class='c012'>Mustapha Kemal must put on record “The Birth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>a Nation”; and from Halidé Hanoum we want the
thousand and one pictures of the agony of simple folk—desolate
village homes, women who weep <i>and</i>
work, the little ones crying, “What is it, mother?”;
all that war means to men, all that men can endure
for liberty and the right.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What does it matter,” she has written, “though
the world call us pariah? We will die with honour.
What does it matter if food be denied us by all our
neighbours? Our own soil will keep us alive,
sheltered in sackcloth!”</p>

<p class='c012'>At Lausanne the patriot-passion is taunted for its
arrogance. It is forgotten that self-made nations,
like men, if made with honour, have certain
rights and duties, which the most illustrious
and ancient lineage cannot bestow. Moreover, we
carry with ease what has come down to us through
the centuries; what we have suffered and fought for,
we grasp, crying maybe somewhat loudly: “Hands
off!” To be in Turkey, and to learn of the heroism
of her people, is to understand her moderation.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I was naturally keenly interested in the Pasha’s
views on women; I have been still more interested to
hear that, since I was at Angora, he has put his theories
into practice.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have never spoken in England or the United
States without having to answer the most absurd
questions on life in a harem. This time, in London, the
old nonsense was trotted out, and my replies either
invented or distorted.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was interviewed during our own Suffrage
agitation, and expressed my conviction that “women
<i>must</i> either have full liberty to earn their livelihoods
in any profession, <i>or</i> be sheltered and protected as
Turkish women are sheltered and protected.” Next
morning a large poster appeared with the legend, <i>under
my portrait</i>, “English writer urges polygamy!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The paper inserted my prompt denial, but, of
course, that never was read by thousands who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>swallowed the poster. A Glasgow paper, indeed,
was considerate enough to remark that, “knowing
my people were Presbyterians, the kindest interpretation
was—insanity!”</p>

<p class='c012'>American pressmen were particularly furious with
me for asserting that polygamy does not exist in
Turkey, and that no Turkish women would put up
with the European system of “establishments.”
When they persisted that “Turks had more than
one wife,” I asked, “why many men, who lacked the
means or courage to ever marry, yet supposed the
men of the East could each have four?”</p>

<p class='c012'>In my judgment, “Progress for Women” has <i>begun</i>
on far sounder lines in Turkey than elsewhere. The
occasion has come to help them, and I believe they
are ready to meet it. There is to-day so much to be
done for their country that few, surely, will hesitate
to come forward and stand beside the men in the great
work. Temptations to rivalry or competition scarcely
exist.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ten years ago, that eloquent and graceful speaker,
Hamdoullah Soubhi, was urging the women to freedom,
bidding them cast off their veils and help to
govern the country. To-day it is Mustapha Kemal
himself who, in season and out of season, is calling
on them to break for ever with the harem, and learn to
be helpmates to their husbands.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have said and written, over and over again, that
women should not, and need not, compete with men.
That is not the real road to freedom. Liberty
dwelleth among comrades, and shuns a rival.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This time next year,” said Mustapha Kemal,
“woman must be free. She must uncover her face
and mix with men.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How will the men like it?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It matters little what they like or dislike. Freedom
must come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He has no more patience with tradition in
men’s dress. “When summer comes and our kalpaks
are too hot, we shall wear hats with ‘brims,’ to
protect us from the sun. The time is past for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>‘dress’ to reveal the ‘race’. We should dress for
comfort.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hamid Bey and other delegates at Lausanne are of
the same opinion. They say the old conventional way
of dressing “stamps the Turk in Europe as a member
of an inferior race.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Taking my courage in both hands, I ventured to
mention the fear his friends had expressed to me, of
his marrying a princess.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That will never happen,” he replied. “I have
already chosen an educated woman of my own people,
with character enough to be ‘equal partner’ in all
my work. There can be no happiness in union for
only <i>half</i> one’s character and one’s life. But I stand
for democracy, and was never attracted by rank.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Everyone now is talking of Mustapha Kemal’s
future wife. The ring was bought for him at
Lausanne by the delegates, who were as excited about
the business as any school-children. His neighbours,
sweet little Mme. Ruchène Echref and her talented
husband are beside themselves with delighted anticipation
of having so charming a <i>châtelaine</i> at Tchan-Kaya.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mme. Ruchène told me that the Pasha was staying
with his future father-in-law during the Moudania
Conference, and that Latifée Hanoum proved herself
most helpful over all his despatches, as she speaks
and writes excellent English and French.</p>

<p class='c012'>The wife to be could have no better sponsor
than Mme. Echref! She and her husband, like Adnan
Bey and Halidé Hanoum, gave up everything to follow
the Pasha. They would not, however, allow me ever
to speak of their sacrifices, or tell the tale of their many
tragic sufferings in all parts of Turkey. Now, indeed,
their dear little two-roomed cabin, so tastefully furnished
with its beautiful pictures, may well stand for
“love in a cottage.” She does a great deal of Red Crescent
work among the women who are still so active
in helping the refugees of Anatolia.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>One only wishes that the other social reforms,
splendidly started in Constantinople, had not been so
long interrupted. But like education, and all other real
progress, they cannot survive long wars. What criminal
waste that means for mankind!</p>

<p class='c012'>I have talked with many Turkish brides, received
many confidences, and the whole question of marriage
in Turkey has always interested me immensely.</p>

<p class='c012'>The first Turkish bride I ever met, long years ago,
had never seen her husband before marriage, and
detested him from the first. “There is nothing the
matter with him,” she admitted, “<i>except</i> that I don’t
like him.” Ultimately she managed to escape, married
a man of her own choice, and was twenty times more
unhappy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another bride told me that, as a great favour, she
was allowed to see her future husband, and has regretted
it ever since. “The dreadful imprudence
seems to have robbed life of all its romance!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet one more confession! “I peeped through the
lattice-window to look at him as he walked past.
Quite an uninteresting little man, but he was ‘my
fate’ and I might have ‘been given’ something
worse.” But, at her wedding, I found a tall and
handsome bridegroom. “What does this mean?”
I asked. “What has happened?” And she answered
quite calmly: “I must have looked out at the wrong
man.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Tewfik Rushdi Bey declares that it is “easy
divorce” in Turkey which makes their marriages so
happy <i>and</i> lasting. I gladly pass on the paradox
to all English advocates for “marriage reform”;
only bidding them remember that Turkish husbands
accept big risks at the start. They never hesitate
about trusting their mothers to “pick a winner in
life’s handicap”; and, since young Western people,
one and all, prefer their own way to their parents’,
all the “wisdom of the East” may leave them cold.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>European bridegrooms must always experience a
sense of being “outsiders” at their own weddings;
but at least we expect them to be there! In Turkey,
the signatures of bride and bridegroom are not affixed
to the contract in each other’s presence, and often not
even on the same day. It is scarcely necessary to
add that the guests belong to the bride’s party, and
are entertained at <i>her</i> house. To us it certainly is
strange to hear the solemn questions addressed to the
bride by the Imam that pledge her life to an “absentee”
partner, whom she has never set eyes on. I can still
remember a beautiful wedding-dress of white satin
brocade, embroidered with silver stars, over which
sparkled a large diadem of diamonds. All brides, too,
wear a shower of silver threads round the neck, from
which they pull out threads to give their friends for
“good luck.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good luck” at a wedding naturally means a good
husband, and from the number of threads I have
received, there should be at least fifty “eligible partners”
somewhere in waiting for me.</p>

<p class='c012'>We, in our turn, wish happiness to the bride on her
bridal throne, as we pass before her in solemn procession.
Last of all comes the feast, for women
only, after which the happy couple are, at last,
“introduced.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this charming and strange ceremony I also
witnessed a fine example of true democracy as practised
in the East. Among the guests in their elaborate
ball-dresses, trimmed with orange blossom, I noticed
the Grand Vizier’s wife; and then, catching sight of a
very differently attired group of women, wearing faded
and worn tcharchaffs and feradjés, I realised that
the “bath-women” of the family had come uninvited
to the feast! And the door of the harem was wide
open, that <i>all</i> might enter in to see the presents,
admire the dresses, and all the other delightful feminine
intimacies of such an occasion.</p>

<p class='c012'>As a matter of fact, I was told by Zeyneb, <i>any</i>
woman can go to a Turkish wedding without having
been invited. “<i>You</i>, in England, only ask your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>intimate friends, and yet you have to employ detectives
to watch the presents.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When my attendant, Cadem Haïr (whose colour
led me to call her Miss Chocolate) became engaged to
a coffee-coloured railway official, she was treated like
one of the family by the Pasha’s household. Fatma
and I bought her trousseau, we arranged for her to be
photographed, and secured a Kara Kheuz (or Punch
and Judy show) for the wedding festivities.</p>

<p class='c012'>So many confidences, so many romances and love-stories
inside the Imperial harem, and outside! They
would fill a volume.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have never met an “old maid” in Turkey, and
I doubt whether one could be found. I well remember
the distress and anxieties of a certain matron whose
daughter was still unmarried at twenty-eight. The
girl had resolutely refused all offers, and her poor
mother could only suppose she had been bewitched.
Then one day <i>he</i> appeared, and that story had a
happy ending.</p>

<p class='c012'>Whether the reforms Mustapha Kemal is so determined
to promote will substantially diminish the
number of early marriages, one cannot, of course,
foresee. At present, fortunately, the most brilliant,
practical, and advanced Turkish women have found
<i>their own</i> sphere, and do not enter into open competition
with men. If they are tempted to follow our
Western feminists, to steal, not only men’s prestige,
but their bread and butter, domestic chaos and anarchy
may spread to the East.</p>

<p class='c012'>For the moment, one does not expect advance
beyond “The Pasha’s” own striking example. He has
not only chosen his own bride, but dispensed with the
Imam—a parallel to the first Englishman who dared to
marry in a registry office!</p>

<p class='c012'>I always said this man would scatter many <i>coupés
d’état</i>, once peace was signed; but he has not waited for
the signature!</p>

<p class='c012'>The originality of his gifts to the bride recalls the
Prophet of Islam. Mahomet gave his daughter a
Koran, a prayer-carpet, and a coffee-mill; Mustapha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Kemal has given his wife-to-be General Trécoupis’
revolver and an Arab horse! She is an excellent
rider, sitting astride, with the veil only confining her
hair.</p>

<p class='c012'>I much regret that I was never able to find an
opportunity of meeting this lady, partly because she
was educated at Chislehurst, almost next door to
my own school—Rochester.</p>

<p class='c012'>Inevitably the Pasha’s liberal attitude towards
marriage has been criticised, and described as
“in direct opposition to the principles of Islam.” He,
however, will not admit the charge.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is true that, at the very door of Europe, women
have been content to live through the centuries in a
comfortable material security, that means being cut
out of all the realities of life, and all the serious
joys or sorrows of existence. It is not unnatural that
isolation should have kept them down so long.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the harem was <i>not</i> invented by the Turks, and
has nothing in common with the nomad existence of
the Great Preacher of the Deserts. Polygamy and
the harem were first introduced when the Turks
entered Byzantium as conquerors. They served, in
those troublous times, as the best means available
for the protection of women, and proved a fine school
of instruction for Georgian Circassian slaves.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is false to say that Eastern women have
blamed their religion for the evils, so many now recognise,
of seclusion. The most ignorant are quite
familiar with the great names of women who have been
the glory of Islam. Mahomet’s own daughter, the “Lady
of Paradise,” spoke to large audiences of dusky-skinned
Arabs, her face unveiled. Neither did Zeyneb, the
famous and beautiful professor at the University of
Bagdad, wear the veil. Khadidja sang in public,
her own beautiful songs, still known and admired all
over the East. Rhadyah, one of the first great travellers
among these lands, was also an eloquent lecturer,
applauded by the most learned men of Islam.</p>

<p class='c012'>Therefore are not the women themselves to blame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>for their prolonged isolation? or was it the régime of
Abdul Hamed?</p>

<p class='c012'>Mustapha Kemal has not only offered his wife the
privileges Mahomet accorded to his daughter, but he
has swept from the path of Islam the retrograde
heresies that Byzantium grafted on to the Faith.</p>

    <div>A TURKISH CABINET—THE THREE BEST-KNOWN MINISTERS—A CABINET OF YOUNG MEN</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Unlike</span> the European type to which we are accustomed,
the Cabinet of the Assembly is almost exclusively
composed of very young men, possessed, however, of
the strong determination to serve their country.</p>
<p class='c012'>Mustapha Kemal Pasha has great faith in youth,
and his oldest minister is probably no more than forty-two.
“Youth,” he said, “makes mistakes that can
be corrected; age and experience make the mistakes
of routine.” Fethi Bey, who is the chief’s right hand,
also believes in youth, and was himself a minister at
thirty-two.</p>

<p>RAUF BEY—PRIME MINISTER.<br /><span class='sc'>Ex-Naval Officer.</span><br />He speaks perfect English and knows England better than any other Turk.<br />p. 192</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Here, again, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet are
independent, the one of the other. One may fall, while
the other remains. I am inclined to think, on closer
examination, that the Ministers are seldom entrusted
with the initiative and responsibility which <i>our</i> Ministers,
in theory at least, enjoy; although for them all criticism
and supervision comes, as it were, from below.
They might, perhaps, be best described as Heads of
Departments, whose every action is open to all eyes
in the Assembly, submitted to the keenest scrutiny,
and freely discussed. Sometimes they seem able to
keep their position after heated discussions and interpolations,
but, on the other hand, they may fall in
consequence of some detail which, with us, would pass
unnoticed—such as the nomination of an unsatisfactory
functionary. They are all, certainly, very able men;
with extraordinary energy, enthusiasm, and devotion.
Although not constituted as a formal Cabinet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>they meet to consider the most important questions
that will come before the Assembly. Mustapha
Kemal Pasha is entitled to preside at these meetings
whenever he desires to be present; but, as a rule,
the Chair is taken by Rauf Bey, Prime Minister without
a Portfolio. They are not appointed by the President
or the Prime Minister, but <i>elected</i> by the whole Assembly.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have discussed this system with many of our
European statesmen, who, one and all—including Lord
Curzon—do not consider that it could permanently work
well or be successfully applied to any stable, important
State.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Turks, however, maintain that a Minister should
only be elected to watch, as it were, the special interests
and concerns of his Department, and that the
<i>People</i> themselves should be <i>responsible</i>, through their
representatives in Parliament, for <i>all</i> legislation. The
Assembly controls both law-making and administration.</p>

<p class='c012'>For them, of course, we of the West cannot decide,
or, perhaps, judge. We have scarcely of late years
earned the right to criticise!</p>

<p class='c012'>Rauf Bey is a man of about forty, a gentleman
as we understand the word, who has travelled among
the best intellects of Europe, and had the courage and
energy to adapt many ideals thus acquired to the needs
of his own country. His brilliance and his devotion
are universally acknowledged.</p>

<p class='c012'>Formerly a Naval officer, he distinguished himself
in all the wars of the last twenty-five years; and his
command of the <i>Hamidieh</i> in the Balkan War, against
the whole of the Greek Fleet, is not yet forgotten.
As Marine Minister in Izzet Pasha’s Cabinet he accompanied
General Townshend and Admiral Calthorpe to
Mudros, and signed the Armistice with the Allies.
In the Chamber of Deputies at Constantinople he did
not hesitate to avow his allegiance to Mustapha Kemal,
and was consequently one of the first to be arrested by
the English and sent to Malta. Handsome, intelligent,
a hard worker, subtle and liberal-minded, he very
soon came to the front. He was the first Vice-President
of the Assembly, and became Prime Minister last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>May. During the absence of Ismet Pasha at Lausanne,
he also acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p class='c012'>I heard him several times during my stay in Angora,
and his fearless speeches were not only a political
event, but always caused something of a sensation outside
the capital.</p>

<p class='c012'>He has never disguised his love for England, nor
what he owes to her education. The disillusion after
Mudros and at Malta was hard to bear. He had not
only to mourn for a shattered idol, but to suffer abuse
from his fellow-countrymen for a trust of which he had
been so proud.</p>

<p class='c012'>He is, however, far too intelligent to quarrel with a
whole nation for the errors of its Government. “The
future depends on England,” he said; “we can do
nothing to improve relations until peace is signed;
but there will be abundant opportunities in the future,
and, if England is willing, she can come to us then.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In six months,” I replied, “we shall be as great
friends as ever we were.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That, again, depends entirely upon you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I asked him whether large concessions had been made
to France in return for her political support.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As the first to understand the Nationalist movement,”
he replied, “we owe her a great moral debt;
which I have myself acknowledged and called on the
world to witness. But for concessions, the field is open
to all. We shall, naturally, accept the most advantageous
offer.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Rauf Bey has strong theories about education;
and has determined that it shall be made to develop
the new Ideal. He closed a school at Adalia because
the children had been taught that Smyrna is Greek and
the Eastern villayets are Armenian. “Every Turk
should learn that Smyrna has never been Greek; an
alien minority, protected by foreign powers, has been
the cause of all our troubles.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is, obviously, of the first importance that Turkish
children should be inspired, from the beginning, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>loyalty to the Fatherland by knowing the fine story
of its growth. “We need schools, and good foreign
schools,” said Rauf Bey, “but until they will work
under our supervision and control we show no favour
to any offender, French, American or Italian—we close
all.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I hear that in the American College at Broussa a
Turkish woman has been appointed to teach geography
and history, a concession one hopes will soon be generally
adopted.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Rauf Bey had told me, on board the <i>Agamemnon</i>,
what had been said to Admiral Calthorpe when the Armistice
was signed: “We are here to end the terrible
bloodshed of so many years. We accept these terms
because we know that the great English nation and the
Allies will keep their words.” Then, to his own
officers: “Is it not true, gentlemen, England always
keeps her word?” and they all answered, “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But we know what happened!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>So much has been written about his unfortunate
reception in London in 1922, that Fethi Bey, the
Minister of the Interior, is well known to us. Seeing
that everyone is given a courteous hearing in Turkish
Ministries, one feels this unnecessary discourtesy the
more. And Fethi Bey, like Mustapha Kemal Pasha
and Rauf Bey, was an ardent admirer of England,
cured for ever by the war of any affection for Germany.</p>

<p class='c012'>As an Army officer, for two years military attaché
in Paris, secretary to the Committee of Union and Progress
in Sofia, and Minister of the Interior in Izzet
Pasha’s Cabinet, Fethi Bey has had a varied and useful
career. During his stay in Sofia, Mustapha Kemal
was his military attaché, and they were both
staff captains at Salonika. It was as a prisoner in
Malta that he learnt the fluent English he had so little
occasion to speak in London.</p>
<p class='c024'>&nbsp;</p>
<div class='box1'>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Fethi Bey, Minister of the Interior of New Turkey.</span></p>

<p class='c012'>No picture of Angora could be complete without a photo of Fethi Bey.
As this has not arrived in time, we leave his place empty, as one leaves the
place of the absent friend at the festive board—unfilled.</p>

</div>
<p class='c025'>He is very observant and far-seeing, undemonstrative,
and, despite his charming smile, bitingly sarcastic;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>not, perhaps, quite so daring as Rauf Bey, but more
level-headed. In a country devastated from end to
end, and lacking in every necessity, he has shown marvellous
skill as an organiser. Very early each morning
he leaves his simple villa at Tchan-Kaya for the tiny
primitive office in which he “handles” a constant
stream of callers, busy about every variety of concerns,
with an almost American speed. After a hasty
lunch he goes to the Assembly, and finally rides home,
often through many inches of snow, in which no car
or carriage could make its way.</p>

<p class='c012'>The last of the “three great men” of the Assembly,
Ismet Pasha, is well known and respected in Europe
for his titanic duel with Lord Curzon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Though now only thirty-eight, it was he who created,
out of nothing, the fine army which chased the Greeks
out of Asia Minor. Victor at the two In Eunus,
it was he who won back all the enemy-occupied territory
as far as the Mediterranean. As victor also at Moudania,
it was he who, with a dignified courtesy that
astonished the whole Conference, defended the
“Nationalist” interests at Lausanne.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of the other personalities in the Cabinet one could
write much. To understand, and sum up, the strength
and importance of the Assembly, one must meet and
know them all.</p>

    <div>TURKISH CABINET—THE LESS-KNOWN MINISTERS OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>In</span> judging the members of the Cabinet one must realise
that some of them do not speak any European languages,
and know little, or nothing, of Western ways. In some
cases, for example that of Hassan Fehmi Bey, the
Minister of Finance, this is due no doubt to their
humble origin. They tell me, however, he “knows
the requirements of New Turkey.”</p>
<p class='c012'>The Minister of Education, Sefa Bey, represents
Adana and is somewhat the same type of man, reserved
and timid to exaggeration.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>There are many Deputies in the Assembly of wider
knowledge and better understanding outside their own
country who would seem, at least to us, more suitable
men for these important Ministries. But we cannot
expect to understand all the influences which determine
the election of a Turkish Cabinet; only hoping that,
as the years pass and the Assembly becomes concerned
with wider issues, it may be led by men, assuredly no
less loyal to their own nation, who yet desire rather to
understand our civilisation, to live in closer contact
with Europe, than merely to turn away from us as
the object of their eternal hate.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The host who has so graciously welcomed me to
his home in Angora is Feszi Bey, Minister of Public
Works. He learnt something of Europe, and a little
of the French language, when exiled to Malta. I have
already recorded evidence of his kindness and generosity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>which is certainly not confined to the horses he
shelters with so much care in preference to any thought
of damage his carriage must suffer by exposure.
Simple in tastes and manner, he yet gives one the impression
of great power and activity; while the remarkable
agricultural schemes inaugurated on his vast
estates have been carried out with prudence and success.</p>

<p class='c012'>Kiazim Pasha, the Minister of National Defence, is
a young man on fire with energy. He was in command
of an army and corps at Sakharia and largely responsible
for the supplies and the organisations which led
the army of Ismet Pasha to victory. Like many impulsive
natures, he is subject to frequent attacks of
pessimism, from which I have striven to rouse him by
the assurance that we <i>will not have</i> war.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Minister of Economics, Mahmoud Essad Bey,
is, of course, responsible for agriculture, commerce, and
industry. Having studied these subjects in Switzerland,
his practical activities are guided by sound
theoretical knowledge.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ali Fouad Pasha was the distinguished general who
fought against the Greeks in September, 1921, and
has succeeded M. Kemal as President of the group
formed to uphold the “Rights of Roumelia and Anatolia.”
The Assembly itself developed, or grew out
of, this little band of patriots, who are still its leading
spirits, the chief inspirers of its policy. At present,
the opposition which <i>does</i> exist has very little
power or influence; a drawback, as we know to our
cost, in any Parliament; which, however, may very
well be of temporary advantage to the Assembly until
the Turks are really secure from external interference.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I was again impressed, almost startled, by the
change that is in progress in the conditions of life in
Turkey, as I looked down upon the present Cheik-ul-Islam,
called in, “as a mere form,” to depose the
Khalif, with no more ceremony than one directs the
dentist to extract a tooth.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the old days I well remember the odour of incense
and sandalwood in the sanctuary of Abdul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Hamid’s Cheik-ul-Islam, as the great man sat cross-legged
under his enormous pumpkin-hat, amidst the
picturesque surroundings of historic, ancient, religious
ceremony. To him it seemed that for a cheik to
dethrone a Sultan, as he foresaw must soon be the
command, would be a solemn and awful thing. I
could not imagine <i>him</i> modestly waiting for orders,
as his successor is waiting to-day. How are the
mighty fallen!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Though propaganda has busied itself already,
in the attempt to find flaws in the power and popularity
of Mustapha Kemal Pasha, his supremacy remains
unquestioned. So far, when his party says go,
the Assembly goeth, and when he says come, it
cometh.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is certain, nevertheless, that, as the new order
settles in its stride, the Government will be confronted
with many difficulties of which we cannot
as yet foresee the precise nature. M. Kemal is at least
two centuries ahead of some of his own Ministers, four
hundred years in advance of the peasants, now
suddenly, without preparation, made citizens of a
Republic—a sovereign people. I have seen the
peasants in their homes—those charming little pictures
out of the sixteenth century. Without the least knowledge
of, or interest in, what <i>we</i> have come to call
civilisation, these simple folk have been vegetating
through the centuries, free from the noise of great
cities and the anxieties of progress. Though always
ready to fight and die, as we say “for King and
Country,” the symbol of their faith and inherited
traditions, they had, and still have, no idea whatever
of any government system, or who makes the laws.
Naturally sober and religious—not poor, since they
had always enough bread—these children of the soil
have known no ambition to improve their quiet
and happy lives.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>It may be Kemal Pasha could do more with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>only his big Ministers and no Assembly. On the
other hand, quicker progress might prove unsettling,
and the founders of New Turkey need no advice from
us. They have chosen what seems to them the
better way; we can but pray for their success.
No doubt, as France floundered through revolution,
they will be driven to face a thousand bitter disappointments
and delays. In times that have well-nigh
submerged the land of the Mother of Parliaments,
the Assembly must face rocks ahead.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now that New and Independent Turkey has her
chance, she should take it. Rome was not built in
a day; and when difficulties come, as come they must,
let none scoff with a cheap “I told you so.” Only
leave Turkey to the Turks, and, like other nations,
they will try and try again, until, at last, they succeed.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>THE FOREIGN COLONY IN ANGORA—A GROUP OF FOREIGN PERSONALITIES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>We</span> cannot complete our record of “Personalities”
in Angora without some mention of the foreigners in
residence. Whatever has been asserted, there are no
Germans there.</p>
<p class='c012'>Quite apart from the Turkish officers’ personal
antipathy, the Germans have no money for concessions;
their educational methods would never take
root in Anatolia; they have lost the legend of military
superiority which was the only <i>raison d’être</i> of their
influence in the past. Before the military genius of
the Turks, their great generals have been compelled
to <i>baisser pavillon</i>. Even during the war Turkey saw
through German bluff, and the taste of army
arrogance was amply efficient to kill the unnatural
alliance for ever. I can definitely assert, by way of
checking the prominence given to false statements of
Teuton influence, that <i>there are no Germans in Angora</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, it is true that a subtle form of
propaganda is still at work in Germany itself. There
a Turk can obtain, by merely showing a passport, a
document that entitles him to all the “special” terms
given to “natives” at hotels, theatres, and shops.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have already described the glories of the Soviet
Embassy, and that distinguished economist, Camarade
Areloff.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Azerbaijan Ambassador, M. Abiloff, represents
the four states of the Caucasian Confederation;
whose rather commercial policy is not very popular.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sultan Ahmed Khan has been representing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Afghanistan in Angora for two years. He tells me that
any communications with his Government seem almost
as difficult as with Persia, whose Ambassador has now
returned to his own country.</p>

<p class='c012'>The personality of Colonel Mougin has done much
for the important commercial interests of his country,
but he is far too wise to imagine that France is the
Power on whom M. Kemal ultimately counts to save
Constantinople from the Russians.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Imbrie, the American commercial attaché, has
been entrusted with the double duty of protecting
concession-hunters from the States and organising
the “American Near East Relief Workers in Anatolia,”
administered in Angora by Mr. Compton and his
charming wife, who must have stepped out of the frame
of a dainty miniature. Mr. Imbrie, by the way, lives
in a railway <i>salon</i>, and when his wife arrives we hope
that her rugs and cushions and curtains may be as
pretty as Mrs. Compton’s.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is very unfortunate that all relief work
has been so wickedly hampered by friends of Armenia
in the States. Their ridiculously unjust, anti-Turkish,
propaganda must have been inspired by the American
version of <i>Ally Sloper’s Half-Holiday</i>!</p>

<p class='c012'>Moreover, Americans never give relief which they
cannot themselves administer. Maybe the implied
affront to Turkish competency is unintentional, but
Kiazim Kara Békir Pasha (who looks after five hundred
orphans without a penny from the State, and has
established many “professional” schools) has a right
to resent it. His compatriots are often tempted to
exclaim, “Keep your dollars,” for American charities
are always administered with a business manner
that scarcely conciliates the recipient; and one must
wonder, for example, how the Armenian priest can
provide for his flock of seventy on four hundred liras
(3,000 francs) a month. They do not evangelise
with much tact, and Turkey can hardly be expected
not to sense the Armenian behind the missionary.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, America has done a great deal for
education, and one sincerely hopes that her colleges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>will keep out of propaganda. Every Turk will
acknowledge the supreme value of the institutions
that have produced brilliant pupils like Halidé Edib
Hanoum, and they will know very well how much the
women of Turkey can gain from them, <i>not</i> to be gained
from their own system of education. I admire
Turkish women very much, and have enjoyed their
company in their own homes, but I am none the less
ready to honour the work of their American teachers
that has already given them so splendid a start towards
real progress and complete freedom.</p>

<p class='c012'>One must not forget the Imperial Ottoman
Bank, now destined, by decree of the Assembly, to
become the Bank of Turkey. The fact will, I hope, be
freely advertised, so that all over Anatolia its origin may
not be forgotten, whilst its increased power becomes well
known, and the people may learn to regard it as what
the French call a real <i>Maison du bon Dieu</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>Already to-day, even in remote places like Angora,
you can “inquire within for everything” at its
well-organised branches. Whether with or without
directions from headquarters, the Bank of Angora is
always ready to supplement one’s stores, and supply
extra beds or special information, and any traveller
in the heart of Asia Minor will know the value of such
little courtesies! Of course, its financial backing
of Anglo-French capital forms the surest possible
passport for universal confidence.</p>

<p class='c012'>We may hope, too, that its official position in the
State may soon have the indirect result of diminishing
our foolish jealousies of French influence. France
asks, and deserves, some gratitude for her courage in
admitting the error of her ways at Sèvres, but she
has no ambition to undermine British interests.</p>

<p class='c012'>Turkey needs capital, and American help involves
interference from men too far away for understanding.
Anglo-French capital, the more the better, means
good terms in the East between us, and real friendship
towards Turkey, for “where their treasure is, there
is the heart also.”</p>

<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>HALIDÉ EDIB HANOUM, AUTHOR AND PATRIOT—A WOMAN DOWERED WITH THE ALL-CONQUERING GIFTS OF THE TRULY BRAVE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>There</span> can scarcely be a worse misinterpretation of
the Turks to-day than the common assumption that
they do not value their women. As an example to
prove this we turn to the charming writer and patriot,
Halidé Edib Hanoum. Not only well known for her work
in England and America, she is respected and honoured
throughout the length and breadth of her own country,
trusted with positions of responsibility, consulted and,
above all, listened to, by those at the helm of affairs.</p>
<p class='c012'>As one of their brilliant journalists once said in the
ante-room of the Assembly: “We gave her a place
in the army. She would have gone with the delegates
to Lausanne had her health permitted. She was
elected a Member of the Assembly, and now we realise
the Constitution does not yet admit women, we shall
remove all such restrictions.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Strong evidence of eager homage to a brilliant
woman emphatically expressed! I had met this
famous lady in the old days, when we were friends
with Turkey, and am naturally anxious to renew the
acquaintance, if only to talk over the terrible happenings
that have transformed her, alas! into one of the
bitterest of England’s enemies. I am sure that, like
Mustapha Kemal, she will be rejoiced to come back
to us when we both change.</p>

<p class='c012'>Her little farmhouse, most charming of rustic homes,
stands on a rough road, at this time of year inches
deep in mud, about an hour’s drive from Angora.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>A clear stream runs by the way, and all around is
silent and calm, save for the very occasional noise of a
passing carriage. In summer, with the sun shining on
the grazing cows, it would seem an ideal spot for this
untiring worker.</p>

<p class='c012'>A voracious reader of the Continental Press, Halidé
Hanoum has told me of her great amusement at the
report that her flight into Anatolia had been “promoted
by a desire to flee from harems and veils.” It is, of
course, in Constantinople that the women have so
largely cast off the old customs, whereas in far-away
Anatolia most are still rigorously kept in seclusion.
“People in Europe simply cannot grasp what our
civilisation means,” she said; “that is what makes it so
difficult for us to come to an understanding.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She and her husband, Dr. Adnan Bey, now Angora
High Commissioner in Constantinople, would have
been imprisoned with the other Nationalists three
years ago had they not managed to escape to these
mountains. Clad in the picturesque costumes of the
villagers, with clogs on their feet, and a few possessions
crowded into a bullock-wagon, they made their
way slowly into Angora, dependent for food and
shelter upon the picturesque, but uncomfortable,
little inns on the way.</p>

<p class='c012'>Since the victory of the Nationalists, she is free, of
course, to seek her equally picturesque home in
the heart of Stamboul; but, “How I love my Angora
farmstead!” she cried, as her quaint peasant waiting-woman
brought in coffee and cigarettes. There was
proof, at least, in the countless books, papers and
souvenirs from England around us that she has not
forgotten her education in the American College;
and, whatever her judgment of us to-day, she speaks
our language without a fault.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the eye travels over the delicately-cut features
of Halidé Hanoum, the expression of sensitiveness
stands out as the greatest charm of her beauty. Yet
the quiet reserved manner cannot hide the force of
her mind and her compelling personality. Charm,
intelligence, great talent and courage, are all in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>dower. What is it one admires the most? For me,
certainly, the all-conquering gift of the <i>truly brave</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>As my father used to say of General Gordon:
“In the service of God and humanity, he was the bravest
of men; and in his sorest need or his greatest loneliness,
his courage rose all the time. To have known
Gordon is to say with certainty, ‘God is courage!’”</p>

<p class='c012'>This fragile and thoroughly feminine little lady
was first in the field against Abdul Hamid, one of
the first to understand Angora, to leave all for the
Pasha, to work without ceasing for Nationalism and
the new Turkey. She tells me that a true account
of the Greek atrocities, as <i>she</i> saw them, will be
an important feature of her memoirs, though I
shall be, personally, more eager to read the story of
her own courageous achievements.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is only one of her judgments upon things
as they are which I regret, and believe to be mistaken.
Trained in an American college, and honoured as
she is all over the States, it is but natural
that she should blame England for leading America
astray on the subject of Christian minorities. Here
neither nation assuredly can plead not guilty; but the
exaggeration and the fervour of the false appeal
have come, I honestly believe, from across the Atlantic,
and not to them from us.</p>

<p class='c012'>Halidé’s first literary achievement, for which she
was decorated by the Sultan, was to translate “The
Mother in the Home,” by an American pedagogue of
the sixties; just the kind of book one would expect
an intelligent young girl to choose!</p>

<p class='c012'>I first met Halidé Hanoum just after she had succeeded
in ending her first marriage. The union was
not a happy one—she was then only seventeen—but
it brought her two fine sons, who are naturally very
proud of their mother. Education and training
among American-taught students had made it impossible
for her to lead the old harem existence,
but she was able to give herself up to deep study,
absorbing from her husband’s extensive library the
many original ideas she is now giving to the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>My friends have told me, and I can well believe, how
much one loses of beauty in her exquisite style of
writing from ignorance of the language. One envies
her the rare combination of a first-class Eastern and
Western culture.</p>

<p class='c012'>During the reign of Abdul Hamid she was condemned
to death, and her “Memoirs” will, one day,
reveal to us the terrible suffering of those years. Now,
however, the pendulum has swung back, and she is
reaping the reward of her courageous work for young
Turkey by the high esteem and consideration she
universally receives. She was frequently consulted by
the late Talaat Pasha and the late Djémal Pasha, owing
to her exceptional knowledge of Western institutions.
It was at her house, too, I met the able and charming
editor of the <i>Tanine</i>, Hussein Djahid, afterwards with
us at Lausanne. All Turkey’s great men have visited
her, and visit her still; and, without doubt, much of
the destiny of her country has come to birth, if not
maturity, in her home.</p>

<p class='c012'>Under the shadow of renewed war, this citizen in
the Great Republic of Letters could not refrain from
the sad topics of Greek atrocities and Lausanne,
but soon turned our talk to more congenial thoughts.</p>

<p class='c012'>She asked after John Masefield, and I told her
that he had been a stretcher-bearer during the war,
and recently I sent him a laurel leaf from Rome
with an enclosed note: “Coming events cast their
shadows before!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I believe in frankly telling an author how much
one enjoys his work, and have myself often appreciated
the pleasures of such spontaneous flattery. Was I not
myself grateful to receive from Australian mothers
letters thanking me for “having written the truth
about the Turks.” Their sons were prisoners in
Turkey.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sarojini Naidu, also a friend of Halidé Hanoum,
sent me an exquisite poem during the world’s despair.
As the words went perfectly to the tune of “Rose in
the Bud,” I have sung them again and again for conquest
in sorrow, and rejoiced in their magic power. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>those yearning for higher things, to whom words of
faith bring comfort amidst the cold angles of life, the
little poem may have its message:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nay, do not weep tho’ life be full of sadness;</div>
      <div class='line'>Dawn will not veil her splendour for your grief,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor spring withhold that bright appointed beauty</div>
      <div class='line'>From lily’s blossom or Ashaka leaf.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>After the Constitution of 1918 had been proclaimed,
“Freedom for Women” became one of the
burning questions of the day. Here, Halidé Hanoum
was almost immediately the acknowledged leader,
and has ever since been urging her sisters, with noble
eloquence, to take the position so long denied them
in the life of the country. With her solid backing
from Talaat and Djémal, Djavid and H. Djahid, she
achieved wonders of awakening. In those old days I
had myself contributed to some of the excellent
women’s papers, which were brought out for the
discussion of educational and social problems, among
which I regret to have seen no more of that most
promising sheet, the <i>Kadinlar Dunyassi</i>. At the request
of the Department of Public Instruction, Halidé
Hanoum drew up a programme of Education for
Women and was herself appointed Chief Inspector
of Schools.</p>

<p class='c012'>By the letter of the law at least, Turkish women
are in a much better position than women have yet
secured among us—to the disgrace of Western liberty.
They have always administered their own property,
signed all documents relating to their own affairs,
have the full privileges of a witness in the courts, and
are allowed to plead their own cases—we have not.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>They were, unfortunately, kept back socially during
the retrograde régime of the ruthless Hamid; but their
fine work on the battle-fields of the Balkan wars,
side by side in the ranks with their men, and their
able organisation of the Red Crescent Society, carried
them forward <i>a hundred years</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>There has been a certain amount of agitation for
the abolition of the veil, but the tradition withstands
reform, though it is now no more than a sort of toque,
or turban, such as we also frequently wear. However,
Halidé Hanoum—most advanced of feminists—has
never herself abandoned the veil, probably seeing in it
a Nationalist, if not a religious, symbolic significance.</p>

<p class='c012'>I wish I could reproduce at least some of the finest
passages from some of her lectures. The noble spirit
of her inspiration yet speaks, even to those unable
to follow her words. No one can marvel that she set
her hearers on fire to save “all that remained of the
Turkish Empire—Anatolia.” As she has written,
“It is the love of race which first made the Turks a
mighty people. Whatever may come, rest assured
our race cannot die. It hath immortal life. Though
we stand alone against the world, our love of race
will give us courage. Till we can once more stand
proudly beside the nations, we will fear no obstacle and
shrink from no self-sacrifice!”</p>

<p class='c012'>She gave to Mustapha Kemal Pasha, before
his full powers were proven to all, the words found
on the stone of an old Turkish Padishah:</p>

<p class='c012'>“God appointed me ruler, that the name and fame
of the Turkish race might not be extinguished. I was
not appointed to rule over a rich, but over a poor,
people, scantily supplied with food and clothing. For
the Turkish race I slept not at night, I rested not by
day, I worked for my people till death.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Her work in Syria, interrupted, alas! by the war,
has established her remarkable powers of organisation;
and though she denies that she was ever actually in
the Cabinet, no one can doubt that she would make a
splendid Minister of Education. The deputies themselves
are so eager for her admission to the Assembly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>that we may easily soon hear that the department
has been placed in her able hands.</p>

<p class='c012'>At Beyrout she converted the big building of the
Dames de Nazareth into a fine school, where, faithful
to her Western training, she gave special prominence
to Swedish drill, and where, as in the American
colleges, Moslem and Christian sit side by side. When
the English advanced in Syria she handed over her
schools, and her Armenian and Turkish orphans, to
the Americans, with the womanly entreaty that they
would “care for them and, above all, make them good
boys and girls.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Turkey of her dreams and ambitions stands
for peace and territorial integrity, for progress in
education and equal rights to Moslems and Christians.
She knows when peace comes that England, with
no thoughts of intrusion, will yet be only too glad
to help. England is generous and hospitable. Turkish
students, in medicine and other faculties, have long
been with us (at Bedford College and elsewhere),
conquering all difficulties of language, climate, and
social customs, taking their degrees, etc, beside British
women. Our schools, our hospitals and clubs will
always welcome all who wish to come to us: as Halidé
Hanoum knew well, before I reminded her.</p>

<p class='c012'>Despite their limited heritage, often from mothers
who cannot read or write, Turkish women are brilliant
students. I well remember trying to interest the
public in a friend of mine who, after specialising in
Gynæcology at Dublin, secured a London M.D.
But the paper which could not find space for this
interesting achievement gaily printed long columns
of “Arabian Nights” nonsense about the strange
ways of Turkey which belonged, in fact, to the period
of the woad-stained ancient Britons. If the public
really must have cheap romance, they would not
complain of an approximately correct date!</p>

<p class='c012'>It is fortunate, indeed, for Turkey that their leading
feminist will work for progress on sound lines, and is
far too wise to see no farther for women than a junior
partnership with men.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>There are, at present, but few feminine stars
in the Turkish firmament. But all are loyally united
in one common cause—to gain their freedom and save
the Fatherland. It is too soon for us to indulge in
prophecy on what their final self-organisation may
achieve.</p>

<p class='c012'>Halidé Hanoum, like so many others, is trying to
regain the health she spent so generously during the
war. Attached to the army as a sergeant, she followed
the troops without a thought of danger and fatigue;
and since the recent hostilities she has ridden from town
to town throughout Anatolia, collecting and arranging
her report of the Greek destruction and atrocities.
This report, controlled by experts and neutral commissions,
was sent to the Lausanne Conference. Halidé
Hanoum’s expression is sad. “How can I help loving
my Anatolian home?” she said. “It has cost us such a
terrible price in lives and suffering to save our land,
we naturally would all die now rather than live in
slavery again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am horrified to hear,” she went on, “that anyone
can still attribute the fire in Smyrna to the Turks.
Why do they not accuse them, too, of burning Asia
Minor? Will it always have to be so? Although the
Greek atrocities committed in our land are too horrible
even to talk or write about, excuses are always found
for the Greeks, while anything done by the Turks is
grossly, unjustly exaggerated. If one Christian dies,
the whole Christian world is concerned, as it should be.
But, on the other hand, when a whole community of
Moslems is wiped out, no one cares.... It is this
spirit of injustice that exasperates Moslems. Now,
however, our recent victory gives us the right to demand
equal consideration with Europeans, no more, no less.”
But, “speaking of Greek atrocities,” she continues,
“the world has simply <i>got to know</i> what they were
during this war. Dr. Nansen, of the League of
Nations, is busy lecturing on the Greeks’ suffering, but
what of the Turks’? All the terrible devastation to
which you can testify, all the number of women and
children burnt and violated; the world must have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>these figures to pass judgment on the Greeks. This
eternal and unjust fault-finding with the Turk not
only breaks his spirit (remember he is an Asiatic), but
incites him to do things he never otherwise would
think of doing. It is a most dangerous policy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With regard to the Conference, Halidé Hanoum
seems to have lost her usual optimism. “Are we right to
have faith?” she asked. “We all of us welcomed
a change in the British Government, and hoped that
our interests would be impartially discussed at
Lausanne, but what is happening?”</p>

<p class='c012'>The two actions which Halidé Hanoum considers
<i>most</i> unjust to Turkey are the endeavours to exempt
Christians from military service and the retention of
the Greek Patriarch. “After the effort we have made
to be free, we must have our country to ourselves,
and if the Greeks expect equal rights with the Moslems,
they must fight for those citizen rights. As to the
Patriarch, imagine asking us to keep a man who had
taken advantage of his sacred calling to turn his
flock against us.... Will the Western Powers always
interfere? All our history goes to prove that Turks
and Christians have lived together in perfect harmony.
When the Powers began to interfere, however, the
Christians showed the basest ingratitude. They invented
the most wicked stories, knowing there was no
justice for us, and that whatever they said would be
believed. Now the Powers who turned the Christians
against us cannot keep their promises. The
Christians want to come back to us. But we will have
<i>no more</i> interference.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If the Conference is only to be an excuse to wear
the Turks out, why should we wait, only to fight in
the end? A policy of slow death is intolerable. We
do not seek war, though we are ready to fight,
because we want to build up our country, take care
of and educate our people, and give them a little of
the comfort and happiness they deserve. Rather
than have an unjust vassal-peace,” she concluded,
“let us perish altogether.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>The picture of Halidé Hanoum confronts us on
all sides throughout Anatolia. Among the heroes
of the revolutions, the Turks reverence her as their
Joan of Arc. No history of the Nationalist movement
can ever be attempted or thought of without a full
record of her courageous loyalty and untiring patriotism.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I was once asked to suggest the best way of helping
forward the cause of women in Turkey. I naturally
answered that I would give them England’s <i>best</i>:
her social and nursing service, but, above all, her
literature. M. Henri Taine wrote of us: “The
English are a horrible race, but they have done all
there is to be done in literature.” It has always
made me ashamed to find so few English books in
Turkish schools. Of course, at present, our language
is not widely known among these people; but, as the
nations of the world grow closer in thought and faith,
one hopes that they, too, may share the inspiration
and moral uplifting so many have found in our best
classics.</p>

<p class='c012'>We should surely endeavour to remove the reproach
implied by the words of Professor E. J. Browne:
“French influence has played too large a part, both
in the political and literary field, in the evolution of
New Turkey, and French ideas have too long dominated
Turkish reformers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The life of Florence Nightingale and her precepts,
our science and the writings of George Eliot, these
few names and ideas may serve to indicate the treasure
we have for all men. Our literature is a gold mine,
which I, for one, long to see given its full honour
and pre-eminence in the education and development
of the women of Turkey.</p>

    <div>HOSPITALS—SCHOOLS—EDUCATION AND THE NATIONALIST WRITERS—THE DAYS PASS, BUT THERE IS STILL MUCH TO BE DONE AND SEEN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>One’s</span> first impression of Angora would lead one to
imagine that everything could be seen in a very
short time; but the days pass, and there is still much
to be done. I have visited the Governor, and congratulated
him on the progress of the town’s development,
which has advanced steadily, even since my
arrival. If there were only peace, one could soon
hope for completion.</p>
<p class='c012'>My guide, Vely Nedjdat Bey, understands what
will interest me most; and the efforts of the Red
Crescent, disclosed on our round of the hospitals,
have given me a most agreeable surprise. The
sanitation leaves much to be desired from
our Western standards, but progressive Turks have
now learnt the importance of such matters, and are
determined to change their old ways, after the peace.
It would be a formidable undertaking, at the moment
impossible, to carry out the drastic alterations that
are essential in these primitive buildings, with no
modern heating apparatus, and so few well-trained
professional nurses. Under such conditions they have
done marvels with serum, and have actually kept
down cholera, typhus, typhoid, and small-pox with
extraordinary success. It is only unfortunate that
they have adopted the French method of typhoid-inoculation
right into the breast, which, though often
effective, is certainly dangerous for women.</p>

<p class='c012'>The military hospital at Broussa—formerly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Splendid Hotel, overlooking a magnificent stretch of
landscape—is excellently organised; and though asked
for criticism by Dr. Nazoum, head of the Army Medical
Service, I could not think of any improvement to
suggest.</p>

<p class='c012'>We spent a morning at the Lycée for Girls, which
was interesting, though I could not, of course, follow
any of the classes in detail. Here, again, one can
obtain the most charming views of the town of Angora,
and I told the headmistress how I longed to carry
away their wonderful front door. She was,
evidently, pleased by the sincerity of my compliment,
and had no fear lest I should follow the example of
the Ambassador at Constantinople. His wife had so
greatly admired a superb Byzantine fountain in our
garden, that my host promptly gave orders for it to
be dug up and sent to the Embassy, where it still
remains!</p>

<p class='c012'>Young as she seemed, the headmistress clearly
recognised the responsibilities of her position, which
were—at once so hampered and so increased—in a
state of war. At many of the Lycées in Anatolia
there was a man as headmaster, his wife being the headmistress;
during the war the men, of course, had all
gone! Education, after all, can do nothing if there is
no Fatherland—no one to educate!</p>

<p class='c012'>One class was being instructed by a hodja on the
meaning of their prayers and the general principles
of the Faith; and I also heard classes in history and
geography, literature and hygiene. I was told that,
in hygiene, the subject that morning was the evils of
alcohol as a beverage. They were taught, however,
in what ways alcohol <i>can</i> be used actually to benefit
mankind. All honour to those who teach their children,
from the first, the terrible curse of drink!</p>

<p class='c012'>The girls recited patriotic poems for my benefit
which sounded very beautiful to the foreign ear. It is,
I suppose, the sequence of even and uneven syllables
which produce this musical effect. They were taught,
apparently, in all subjects to stand up and answer
questions in a short speech: surely an admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>training, likely to ensure their knowing how to
use the language in writing and speaking with far
more correctness, elegance, and effect than most of
our young people ever attempt.</p>

<p class='c012'>I peeped into the dormitories, which, like the class-rooms,
seemed in excellent order. Coffee and tea
were laid out for us in the recreation-room; and before
we left the head-girl expressed their pleasure and
thanks in what was—evidently—a neat and charming
little speech.</p>

<p class='c012'>I felt, however, that, like the headmistress of Broussa
College, my hostess no doubt regretted that there were
now neither Greeks nor Armenians at the school.
There had been no more difficulty in the class-rooms
than elsewhere through life, as to maintaining perfect
harmony between Moslem and Christian. I was told
that, though the latter were generally supposed to
be the cleverer, Turkish girls were, in a way, more
keen and quick to learn. They had, at any rate, a
quite friendly desire not to be beaten, and now
they miss the valuable competition.</p>

<p class='c012'>In olden days, though women even attained to
fame in politics and literature, the general standard
for education was elementary, and no public provision
for it had been made.</p>

<p class='c012'>Primary schools were started about sixty years
ago; secondary and professional schools soon followed.
There are now girls’ schools wherever one for boys has
been established; in most towns also a Lycée for
Girls, and Normal Colleges in many counties of Asia
Minor. There is a Training College at Constantinople,
from which the senior students also attend lectures at
the Women’s University, which shares laboratories
and lectures—in science and medicine—with the
University for men. I suspect, sometimes, Mustapha
Kemal Pasha may introduce co-education throughout!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>So much interesting literature has been produced by
the Nationalist movement, that one must hope Professor
E. G. Browne may, one day, pursue his splendid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>defence of Turkey by giving us extensive extracts from
these writers in English. The greatest of all our
living scholars in Turkish, Persian, and Arabic, he
has devoted his whole life to the fascinating subject;
and Prince Samad Khan has told me that he lectures
in Persian without the trace of an accent.</p>

<p class='c012'>Graciously writing a Preface to my “Englishwoman
in a Turkish Harem,” he said that as “a friend and
admirer of the Turks, as well as a student of their
language and literature, it is always a satisfaction to
me to find a fresh opportunity of testifying to my belief
in the virtues of this much-maligned and ill-used
race.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Recent events, however, seem to have paralysed his
enthusiasm, bringing depression that killed his zeal
for the task he now felt it would be of no avail to
pursue.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Nationalist victory, let us hope, will encourage
him to resume work with a revived, and ever greater,
enthusiasm. I had intended, indeed, to ask him for
a summary of the “Nationalist Literary Revival,”
by way of a chapter in this book. But there was not
time to presume so far on the kindness he has never
refused to show.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have, therefore, reproduced, to the best of my
ability, a few notes put together for me by that distinguished
Professor, Hussein Raghib Bey, formerly
Director of the Angora Press, and now Charge d’Affaires
at the Paris Embassy. He is an exceptionally well-informed
critic in the education, literature and politics
of his own country, which travel also enables him to
compare with the educational systems of Europe.
He told me that, while he admired the thoroughness
of German methods, he could not tolerate their unjust
administration of corporal punishment, which, in
his judgment, vitiated the whole system. Turkish
schools have all adopted French methods; and,
myself a proud pupil of the École Normale Supérieure
de Sèvres, I do not believe there is any finer instruction
in the world. But in the fullest sense of real and
complete education, the best work is being done in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>England. The ideal would seem to be a combination
of the two.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Hussein Raghib took me right back to the “Divans,”
a collection, or portfolio, of more or less national
poems, celebrating the virtues of God and the Prophet.
Love-poetry does not begin before Fouzouli, in the reign
of Suliman the Magnificent. Any ghazals (<i>i.e.</i>, love
songs) that I have heard sung here do not seem to
express our conception of love. The music sounds
more tender and mournful than passionate, and the
song itself is often addressed to the Unknown, to Love
in the Abstract, and not to the individual Beloved.
Again and again I caught the word “pity,” suggesting
ideas and moods we should not expect to find.</p>

<p class='c012'>After the “Divans,” we notice the strong influence of
Persian literature in Turkey, even the introduction
of Persian words—a consequence, no doubt, of wars
in Persia and Arabia. Moreover, the Koran was then
a predominating influence in all literature, as well as in
science; and Arabic was the language of religion.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was Selim, to whom the King of Egypt handed
over the Holy Relics—the standard, the coat, and
the wooden sculptured shoes—with the solemn injunction,
“They are yours—to hold; for you are qualified
to be Khalife.” From that day and for ever, any
Khalife who shall desert his guardianship of the Relics
is, by that sin, self-deposed. And Great Britain, the
largest Moslem Power in the whole world, revealed her
ignorance, or her indifference, by calling Wahid-Eddin,
“The Khalife,” long after his escape to Malta!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>We see, then, that in the days of Sultan Mahmoud
(that is, in our eighteenth century), the Turkish language
was largely composed of Arabic and Persian,
through the influence of religion. Then, precisely as
our people in the old days could not read or speak
the scholar’s Latin of our great literature, the people
of Turkey could not understand their own writers.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>It was about 1339 (in our nineteenth century) that
the cultured and intelligent Schinassi Effendi was
sent to France. As other scholars and men of letters
began to study Western culture in England, in her
turn, Turkey was following European progress, towards
desertion of any scholastic influences and
academic style. Windows, that looked Westwards,
were opening at last, to religion and literature alike.</p>

<p class='c012'>Schinassi Effendi was inspired by a fine, broad-minded
enthusiasm. He secured introductions to
Lamartine and other great French writers; and,
when he returned to Constantinople, immediately set
to work upon a complete revolution of style and outlook
in Turkish literature. With an ideal of most
admirable and direct simplicity, he succeeded in
modelling the language upon the best French, clear
and logical way of construction.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps the most distinguished of his pupils were
Namik Kemal Bey and Adbul Hak-Hamid; but there
were many who helped to extend, and establish, his
literary revolution. They did not, of course, cut
away the whole traditional influence of the Arabs
and the Persians; but, with orderly methods that were
Western, produced almost a new Turkish language
(which their own people could read and appreciate)
that was perfectly adapted for the artistic and imaginative
expression of modern thought and contemporary
life. The European style and intellect, in its purely
native setting, was, naturally, most apparent in their
fiction.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Namik Kemal Bey was among those who died in
exile for their ideals, leaving behind him some most
touching pages in honour of the English character
and constitution. When Zeyneb came to England she
read some of his work to me, just at the time when
some of our Liberal statesmen, to their eternal shame,
had begun to declare their admiration for the Russia
of the Czars. We arranged open-air meetings outside
Sloane Square Station and at a big Opera House—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>protest against the British M.P.’s visit to
Russia. Zeyneb’s comment was simple: “What
would our great Kemal say?” Constitutional England
allied to Czarist Russia!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The acknowledged leader of the New literature
was Abdul Hak-Hamid, for some time a member
of the Turkish Embassy in London. Schinassi and
Kemal stood half-way between the past and this great
modern writer, representing, also, patriotism in
literature, as it dominated prose, at the declaration of
the Constitution.</p>

<p class='c012'>At this time, of course, “patriotism” meant “the
Revolution of 1908,” a united attack on the tyranny
of Abdul Hamid, who had persecuted Turks, Greeks,
and Armenians alike.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once the Constitution had been proclaimed, however,
the Armenians turned to Russia for help to
establish their own independence; the Greeks sought
to revive an “Empire” from Athens.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Turks, who had never hesitated to appoint a
Greek or an Armenian among their Viziers and Foreign
Ministers, who always sent Christian Ambassadors to
England, and who had chosen the Armenian, Gabriel
Effendi Nouradunghian, for their Minister of Foreign
Affairs, were now driven to concentrate their betrayed
enthusiasm upon building up a Turkish nation <i>of their
own</i>—for themselves alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>Their scholars, therefore, devoted themselves to
scientific research; social institutions were founded;
they studied philosophy, national economy, and
sociology; they prepared their own ethnography,
history, and geography, and the reformed Turkish
language.</p>

<p class='c012'>They had, as it were, to build up a complete
learning; almost a universal knowledge; a true
world-culture for Eastern peoples; that, by its
“National” inspiration, should create for Turkey a
spirit and a soul.</p>

<p class='c012'>That great <i>savant</i>, Zia Gueuk Alp, one of the Malta
victims, and afterwards Professor of Sociology at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Constantinople, has done more for the New literature
than any other one writer; as Mehmet Emin Bey,
who lives at Adalia, is their leading poet. They have
others, of course, who produced fine work; among
whom Yahia Kemal would probably prove the outstanding
genius, had he the energy to maintain his
highest gifts. The pangs of a Nation’s Birth, out of
Sacrifice, have found voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are two women of genius in this group.
To Halidé Hanoum we have already devoted a chapter,
in honour of a wise and passionate personality that
has impressed itself on the whole history of a generation.
We in England, I hope, are shortly to have a
translation of her remarkable “Nouveau Touran.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Mufidé Hanoum (Mme. Ferid Bey) also approaches,
though she has not reached, the outstanding genius
of Halidé Hanoum. She is a younger woman, a less
experienced writer, and, maybe, she lacks the inspiration
that comes from long strain and suffering.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There are others,” concluded Hussein Raghib,
“whom you <i>ought</i> to know, though they are not equally
great.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I’ve stayed too long already,” I replied,
“interrupting your work.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And busy men, even in the East, must not neglect
the State for courtesies too prolonged.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hussein Raghib himself has published a very
delightful “Story of Nationalism,” dating from the
Closing of the Turkish Parliament. “As a matter
of fact,” he writes, “the <i>Turc Odjagui</i> was the beginning
of Nationalism.” This was a club founded by Hamdoullah
Soubhi Bey as a protest against “Union and
Progress,” and to place the movement on a national,
as opposed to a party, basis. Halidé Hanoum and
other prominent women were admitted; and its three
thousand members included professional men like
officers, lawyers, doctors, professors and writers; and
men of all nationalities—Greeks and Armenians,
Persians and Arabs. It was closed by the English, but
has recently been re-assembled.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mustapha Kemal Pasha contributed handsomely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>to the funds, and Hamdoullah Soubhi came from
Angora for the re-opening. “As our territory has
become smaller, our intellectual empire must become
wider,” said Hussein Raghib. “That is the spirit
behind the club.” I had, unfortunately, to leave for
Lausanne before the opening ceremony.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I have just been to the famous Hadgi Bairam
Mosque, and found its chief charm, as I expected, in
the exquisite colouring of the carpets and antique
faïences. These glowing scarlets and blues, mauves
and terra-cottas, surely compensate, in some
measure, for all the grey that overshadows life.
Europe would not seem so sordid if we imported more
bright colours from the East—for our <i>East</i> Ends!
Nothing fascinates me so much as the atmosphere
of a mosque; the un-selfconsciousness and natural
reverence of the men at prayers; out of the world,
in Allah’s home.</p>

<p class='c012'>Surely faith is the same for all men, making all
men equal!</p>

<p class='c012'>“The gods,” said my guide, “are three—Goodness,
Beauty, and Truth.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To which I would add Courage,” was my response.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As you please,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c012'>He told me that “The Pasha” and the first Deputies
all came to visit the Mosque before the opening
of the Grand National Assembly, joined by everyone
in Angora—even sceptics—“to lift our hands to Heaven
in prayer, confident that victory must be ours.”</p>

<p class='c012'>We went on to the tomb of the Sainted Man,
robed in shawl and turban, after the picturesque
Eastern manner. The guardian of the tomb was
seated before it on his crossed legs, reading the
Koran; and around him were many women, weeping
over their prayers.... “Is it for peace, or for their
dead?” I wondered!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>That afternoon I determined to try and find out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>all I could about the army from some of my friends
at the Assembly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are very indiscreet,” said the officer, whose
attention I had managed to secure.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know that,” was my reply; “it is a little like
asking St. Peter for just a peep into Heaven.
But you <i>can</i> tell me something?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What do you wish to know? Our normal
military service is for three years. We naturally
have to adopt conscription for an indefinite period
in times of war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What was the meaning of the large crowd at the
Town Hall to-day?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They were enlisting. We cannot let go
now. The sovereign rights of the people must be
maintained.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You were beaten to the dust in the Great War,” I
suggested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We <i>were</i> defeated in Palestine. But most of
our troops went to Cilicia; we were victorious in the
Dardanelles and the Caucasus. Few of the Powers
were forced to scatter their forces along so many
frontiers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The English were nowhere near Mosul,” he went
on, “and they never really broke up our army;
they just took possession of Constantinople and,
through the Greeks, of Smyrna. They taught us
the <i>fait accompli</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was necessary for us, of course, after the rupture
with Constantinople, to reorganise the whole
army. The Pasha was forced to call in officers to
train companies, even irregulars. Ali Fuad commanded
in the North; Refet Pasha in the South. At the
first battle we had two big guns only!</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“The work went on day and night: collecting
and training men, making or repairing arms and
munitions, gathering metal—often from railway lines.
No one thought of rest till all was ready in numbers
and construction. We had ten thousand men in July,
1920, we are four hundred thousand to-day! We
obtained four hundred and fifty big guns, and a fleet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>of aeroplanes from the Greeks; a thousand machine-guns,

    <div>LAST DAYS IN ANGORA: EXCURSIONS, CONVERSATIONS, PICNICS—HAÏDAR BEY’S PARTY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Angora</span>, certainly, carries one back to the centuries
before Christ; although we now realise that life was
by no means without its luxury in those bygone days.
As the houses of Pompeii were warmed by hot air
behind the walls, and the baths were not only hygienic
but luxurious, it would puzzle one to find what now
remains in Angora from the comfortable period of
Augustus. There is also a prehistoric atmosphere about
Smyrna, or as it was once wittily expressed:
“Since its deliverance from Greeks and Armenians,
it has the charm of Sodom and Gomorrah after the
fire.”</p>
<p class='c012'>But every day I am more at a loss to imagine
where the thirty thousand inhabitants of Angora are
living to-day. I have seen some of them in their
charmingly improvised houses, made homelike by the
marvellous carpets of the East; but, as one always
goes back to one’s first love, I give up the problem,
and return to talk with the “élite” at the Assembly.</p>

<p class='c012'>One day I found the Director of the Angora Press,
Aga Aglou Ahmed Bey, in his tasteful little ante-room,
and learnt that he, too, found it hard to forgive
the recent policy of Great Britain. He repeated, also,
the note of despair I hear so often: “Whatever we
do is wrong.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yet,” he added, “had our movement originated
in America, we should have had the whole world at
our feet. All growing nations have been allowed to
separate Church and State. We have, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>troubles within and without, but they have only
strengthened the spirit of Nationalism, which the
Pasha himself could not now destroy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Alas, poor Turkey! Abdul Hamid disposed of
Turks with amazing dexterity: he lost them, killed
them, or forgot them; and who cared? They were
not Christians!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look what it cost us to depose the ‘Red’
Sultan, and then we had the ‘Black’ Sultan. When
we got rid of him, Europe was not pleased. See how
the English are defending him; though one of your
charming countrymen told me they would not give
him ‘house-room’ in your own country.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I suggested, and Halidé Hanoum agreed, we could
not refuse to find a safe home for our vassal; although,
certainly, his visit to Mecca could not be justified
by our refusal to go on paying his board in Malta.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ahmed Bey expressed his enthusiasm for Lord
Curzon’s books on the East. As a young student,
he told me, he had written glowing appreciations of
this brilliant statesman, in whom all the Moslems had
once put their trust. From Malta, he wrote to Lord
Curzon: “One of your greatest admirers, who has often
expressed his eulogies in public, is now in prison, a
prisoner of peace, taken out of his bed....”</p>

<p class='c012'>The names of Calthorpe and Milne will go down
through the history of Turkey; but not to the credit
of England.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here is the charming message sent to me by Aga
Aglou Ahmed Bey, Director of the Press of Angora:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am, indeed, sorry that illness prevents my coming
to tell you personally what your visit means to us,
and the feelings of gratitude and respect that you
inspire in the hearts of all the Turks by your <i>courage</i>
and <i>love of the truth</i>....”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was particularly glad to hear that although, like
most of his compatriots, Ahmed Bey holds that all
propaganda is foreign to the character of the Turks,
he has determined to open a “Bureau of Information”
as soon as Peace is signed. I cannot doubt that this
will be a great benefit to all Islam.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“<i>My</i> propaganda,” I told him, “would be inspired
by the determination to blazon abroad the marvellous
kindness of all your race. Few people have any idea
how hospitable and generous the Turks have been.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dear Mademoiselle,” he replied, “you are right.
We have not the sky-scrapers of New York; but
we have big hearts. Yet we have given you so little
comfort....”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have given me your best, and I appreciate
it. Hygiene and luxury are not everything; though
I have a pet theory of my own as to the holding of
hands between East and West in the realm of hygiene:
‘First, I wash myself <i>à la West</i>, or, as you call it,
in dirty water; then I perfect the ceremony <i>à la East</i>,
that is, in running water. On the other hand, for a
bath, I like to start with the Turkish and end with
the English. You see I am already half-Oriental.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>Though rather exceptionally sympathetic and broad-minded,
I gathered from the Director that he, and
others, were not quite so enthusiastic about the French,
as they, certainly, had been quite recently. Much
was expected of France at Lausanne, and they were
disappointed in proportion.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The <i>Athenaeum</i> published a strange comment on
my last book about Turkey, from a writer who claimed
to know the East: “When a race becomes disciplined
and energetic, the number of blonde women becomes
greater!” I should not myself call many Turkish
men I met blonde; but I have a certain impression
of noticing a number of surprisingly fair men in
Angora; and, maybe, the energy of the Nationalists
is thus evidenced in the lighter colouring of their hair.
If there be even a grain of truth in the theory, it seems
a pity that women of all nations should resort to
peroxide and henna, when a little hard work would
have a better, and more lasting, effect.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>To-day, one feels the Grand National Assembly has
achieved success, and is permanently established.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>This sense of security is, no doubt, partly derived from
remembering what earlier parliaments, with scarcely
less loyal enthusiasm, attempted, and failed to achieve.
I remember my first visit to Adbul Hamid’s Parliament,
and the big hopes by which we were all then
inspired. It had been no easy matter to overthrow
that hideous tyrant, and we have no reason to blame
that Government for not realising our full expectations.
Other governments in other countries have failed again
and again on their road to ultimate success. On that
opening day, too, I remember seeing, with pity and
respect, a pale and lonely figure, seated silent among
the general rejoicings, unnoticed and forgotten. It
was the son of the great Midhat, who had established
a still earlier parliament. All honour to the pioneers.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>On another occasion Djellal Noury Bey, deputy
for Gallipoli and editor of the Constantinople
<i>Illeri</i> (or “Forwards”), gave me some further
impressions of the “Pasha” and of many interesting
Anatolian problems. However closely the leaders
agree on general principles, it is always helpful to compare
as many individual points of view as one can
obtain. Djellal Noury has been to England and the
States, and speaks perfect English and French. We
have mutual friends in London.</p>

<p class='c012'>I asked whether I might go over the National
Pact with him, clause by clause; as although,
or rather because, I am so keen a friend to Nationalism,
I want to be <i>sure</i> whether there are any points in their
scheme, or their aims and attitude, that I <i>do</i> find
fault with, or should like to criticise.</p>

<p class='c012'>He seemed only too delighted that anyone should
care so much for a full discussion of their important
work, and put everything before me as clearly and
thoroughly as I could possibly wish.</p>

<p class='c012'>But I could find nothing unreasonable in a single
clause, if the Turkish nation is to achieve <i>real</i>
nationality.</p>

<p class='c012'>As business men, for example, can the foreigners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>justly wish to maintain exemption from taxes? As
Djellal Noury explained it: “The European and the
Turk buy goods, say at five francs. The European
pays no taxes and can sell for six francs. As the Turk
pays a tax, he has to charge seven francs, and, being
cut out in price, is naturally left with a large stock
in hand. These are conditions which, obviously,
cannot be maintained. Capitulations have strangled
the commerce of the country and its progress.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It may happen that one Power takes out a Concession
for the railways, but cannot, or will not,
fulfil ifs contract. We have to go without railways.
We cannot go elsewhere when a Concession has been
granted.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I complimented Djellal Noury upon the excellence
of his French. “I used to edit a French paper,” he
replied, as he looked round the ante-room in search
of anyone to whom I might especially like to be introduced.
For my part, my attention had just been
caught by one of the hodjas.</p>

<p class='c012'>“These people do not think as we do,” he said,
catching the direction of my glance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you are anti-Islam?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not at all; I am strongly <i>pro</i>-Islam. The
broad-minded dogmas of our religion can meet all
modern requirements, moral or spiritual. But the
Koran is not properly interpreted by the hodjas.
The will of the people is our religion; service is
worship!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I remember a story of Mahomet I heard in Turkey.
“The prophet was one day walking with his disciples,
and passed a group of workmen on the river’s bank who
did not stop their task, even to salute him. When his
disciples inquired whether these men should not be
called to order, he replied: ‘Work and service are the
greatest homage that the faithful can pay to their
prophet.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>I had already conceived the idea that Nationalism
is a religion. One sees the National Pact beside
the bedside, as we have our prayer-books. Colonel
Tewfik has a copy, bound like a small almanac, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>his waistcoat pocket. The principles of Angora are
their “Holy Gospel.” To be a Nationalist is to stand
for your country’s most vital interests.</p>

<p class='c012'>We spoke of the Press—Turkish as well as British.
The whole Turkish Press stands for Nationalism, irrespective
of any opposed local opinions or interests.
With us, the fine independence of other days has departed—one
hopes not for ever. In the hands of a
few party-peers one could, perhaps, expect nothing
better. Were it not anti-Islam, one would name the
<i>Manchester Guardian</i> as the most honest newspaper
to-day.</p>

<p class='c012'>Djellal Noury had given up so many afternoons to
explaining to me the whole policy of Nationalism, that
I was grieved to hear of his having called to see me one
afternoon when a party had been arranged for me by
the colonel to join one of their shooting expeditions.
I wish he could have been persuaded to join us.</p>

<p class='c012'>A special carriage and two of the finest horses in
Angora had been requisitioned for the occasion; and
though the colonel was prevented, at the last moment,
from being with us, we made up four guns, and every
man had two rows of cartridges round his waist.</p>

<p class='c012'>I had visions of our coming Sunday lunch; but, alas!
it was bitterly cold (in spite of rugs and shawls) on
these lovely and picturesque roads, white with frost;
and when we had waited a whole afternoon for the
shooters to shoot, someone at last bagged a magpie.</p>

<p class='c012'>Passing a flock of geese, by which the old woman
of a tiny roadside farm was standing sentinel, I asked
one of the party to hand me a gun with which to shoot
one of the geese by mistake. I remembered in
time, however, that the only time I had ever aimed
at a rabbit, I killed a fox; and I was afraid that by
aiming at the goose I should probably shoot the lady.</p>

<p class='c012'>So they toiled on for another hour with no better
result, and we began to hesitate about facing the colonel
and the director of the Ottoman Bank, where we had all
been invited to Sunday lunch. But on the way back we
were lucky enough to buy a fine, plump hare from two
peasant women we passed on the road; and the colonel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>was boldly informed that it had fallen to Osman Noury.
“Madame Noury must cook him,” cried the colonel,
with a laugh that struck one as rather suspicious.
The colonel supplied champagne; Mme. Noury superintended
the hare and the pilaw; Boghetti brought
some fruit; Oeillet was responsible for the cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c012'>When behold, to the manifest discomfort of
Osman Noury, the colonel began asking awkward
questions about the “where’s and when’s.” “Be careful,”
I said, “the colonel is going to wire to his Government
about it.” When the laughter subsided, Osman
Noury blushingly explained that it had cost him two
Turkish pounds! I am sure neither the fact nor the
confession diminished our enjoyment of the merry feast.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have been very ill to-day, on the point of slipping
out of this world altogether. Not realising the danger
of close proximity to a mangal, I carried the precious
warmth into my bedroom, to feast on its exquisite
purple flames, which I just remember comparing to a
sunset. Fortunately, my faithful maid was in the room
when I lost consciousness, and I was carried out of the
poisonous air.</p>

<p class='c012'>The colonel told me afterwards that before they
knew whether I should recover, he was possessed of a
horrible panic that he could never persuade his Government
I had died by accident.... Everyone will
say “the Turks poisoned you and the Frenchman let
them do it.” Well, I am still here, and the papers
have lost an excellent opportunity for lying copy.
M. Louis Steeg declares: “You surely will never die!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The Pasha has graciously lent me his car for a visit
to Halidé Hanoum. It is a pretty little machine,
lined with blue velvet, which hops and bumps and
plunges along the roads like a kangaroo, swimming
across the river for more miles of twisting acrobatics.
I have always admired the carriage-drivers: before (or
rather behind) M. Kemal’s chauffeur I am dumb.
But, apparently, the cars “don’t mind”!</p>

<p class='c012'>I was imprudent enough to dismiss my conductor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>at the nearest point to my host’s house, which even
he could not reach, and walked on to find the servants
had all disappeared, no doubt to the Mosque, and the
family were not at home! Being in Turkey I did
not hesitate to step down the road and knock at the
first door I came to, which was of plain deal, with the
usual huge lock (quite a foot long) and picturesque
knocker. A thin-faced woman appeared to welcome
me, and, without thinking, I fell back on my stock
greeting: “Mustapha Kemal Pasha, <i>Chok Guzel</i>!”
Accepting my muddy boots without demur, she
smilingly led me into her little two-roomed cabin:
on one side, the sleeping-room with its bed and well-cushioned
divan; on the other, her simple kitchen.
When she had tucked me up on the Divan, and given me
coffee and cigarettes, I did my best at conversation,
and by friendly signs tried to convey my gratitude.
“England is a big country ... M. Kemal’s victory
splendid ... cold weather outside,” my eyes and
hands said.</p>

<p class='c012'>If she did not exactly understand what was in my
mind, she was polite enough to seem thoroughly interested.
I sat on till I could hear the servants arriving
at my host’s house, and with another supply of coffee,
she smiled me farewell, without the slightest appearance
of having resented my lengthy intrusion. They
are hospitable in Anatolia!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Another person I met with pleasure at the Assembly
was Hamdoullah Soubhi Bey. He is a distinguished
writer and orator of about thirty-five, whose white hair
offers a striking contrast to the alert youthfulness of
his face and expression. He has spoken “cultured”
French from the cradle; as, indeed, so many women
of the upper classes know that language far better
than Turkish. Zeyneb uses French in writing to
Halidé Hanoum, being, no doubt, unwilling to trust
her Turkish to so brilliant a writer.</p>

<p class='c012'>It must have been Hamdoullah Soubhi whom I
heard, about ten years ago, plead so eloquently for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>the abolition of the harem. When he showed us what
polygamy so often <i>meant</i> to the children, few of his
large audience could keep back their tears. The
colonel had introduced him, and said that he had been
the Minister of Education. “Why did he give
up the post?” I asked. “Ah, <i>pourquoi</i>!” shrugged
my friend, “it is a delight to talk with him. You,
who love French, will indeed enjoy the exquisite
language in which he clothes his thoughtful opinions.
Such men are an ornament to any parliament.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Hamdoullah Soubhi does not seem to feel so leniently
towards the Greeks as M. Kemal, and is less optimistic
about their return. It had been supposed, he told
me, that the marked differences between the two
races would balance each other; but it has not proved
so, and, in his judgment, they would always clash.
“Our Anatolians, so long neglected and forgotten,
are as they were three thousand years ago: honourable,
firmly resisting all tempest, faithful to the traditions
of their race, loyal to their chosen leader in the
hour of danger.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I told him it should be a lesson for us in Europe,
to find a map of Asia Minor in all the humble homes;
while my host, the Minister of Public Works, always
brings <i>his</i> map on to our breakfast table, to familiarise
me with all the geography of these wide lands. We
are now studying Diarbékir and Kurdistan, not only
the wonderful old towns, but the character of their
cultured inhabitants. No wonder our Lausanne delegates
have so affronted Turkey by their lofty allusions
to the “illiterate” Kurd!</p>

<p class='c012'>“How can our younger civilisations, however advanced
in science and commerce, ever have been so
self-satisfied as to suppose that we could keep down such
people for ever?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our forty millions,” answered Hamdoullah
Soubhi, “will not be so easily suppressed. Remember,
our language is spoken beyond the borders of China,
and our civilisation can be traced all over the world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When I afterwards met Hamdoullah Soubhi, in
a little restaurant adjoining the Assembly buildings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>he was accompanied by a brother of the late Djémal
Pasha. I was glad of the opportunity to tell him
that, “whatever the political mistakes of their former
leader, I felt that the Turks had lost a great man.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The proprietor of this little restaurant is also a
professor. He determined that, while cooks, and
indeed all servants, were almost impossible to obtain,
the deputies should suffer no inconvenience. Now
they all either drop in at the professor’s, or ask him
to send them a snack to one of the rooms of the
Assembly. The ready courtesy with which he offered
to contrive a meal <i>à l’anglaise</i>, for my special benefit,
clearly showed he is always willing to do his best.</p>

<p class='c012'>H. Soubhi Bey’s tastes are very simple, and he
detests show or bluff. “We discard superstitions,
alike in life and religion,” he said; “only the solid
foundations of truth can resist the storm. Our
National Pact, like our faith, is solid, positive, and
true.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>On one occasion I met Haïdar Bey, <i>député</i> for
Vannes, the colonel’s adviser on rugs and carpets,
whom he calls “the old brigand.” He told me,
however, “the fellow was not dangerous;” and
I surprised him by declaring that I had fallen in
love, at the age of eight, with Hadji Stavros, Edmund
About’s “King of the Mountains,” and, in consequence,
was perfectly at home with brigands.</p>

<p class='c012'>HAÏDAR Bey does not carry the chaplet, which so
many Orientals are always counting, in order to check
the temptation to smoke, but I noticed he was
clenching a piece of wax. “He’s training his muscles,”
laughed the colonel. “Brigands, you know, have to
keep themselves very fit!”</p>

<p class='c012'>He seemed to me, as a matter of fact, to have
suffered more, physically, from the allied occupation
than anyone else I met, except Essad Pasha, the
celebrated oculist, obviously destined for constant pain
to the end of his days.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>HAÏDAR Bey had sworn he would never again speak
to an Englishman on account of our officers’ treatment
of his mother. I could only assure him, with all the
earnestness at my command, that the people of
England abominated every form of personal cruelty;
and that one day, when the facts were known, we
should officially apologise, as I now privately expressed
my horror and shame.</p>

<p class='c012'>His response was characteristic of these generous
people! He arranged for me a really charming little
supper-party; making graceful allusions to England
as she was before the war; and as, since my visit, he
had decided to think of her ... “I will only remember
the occupation as a hideous nightmare!”</p>

<p class='c012'>I could sincerely say I had enjoyed every minute of
the evening, from the Circassian chicken specially
prepared for me, to the Oriental music and Abdul
Hamid’s own cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our host himself had graciously come for us an
hour before the appointed time; a prudent gallantry,
to ensure the arrival of his guests in the crowded
quarter described as “near the pump, which is perhaps
near the Mosque”! with neither street-name nor
number to assist the traveller.</p>

<p class='c012'>Aided by sticks and lanterns, we accordingly
prepared to face the dangers of the way. It was impossible
to hear oneself speak in the biting wind; and
our host, with his “lantern under thy feet,” as the
Bible calls it, was fully occupied in guiding us away
from big stones and wide holes.</p>

<p class='c012'>We were glad to reach his dimly-lighted room;
over-heated, indeed, to Western ideas; and sink into
the cushioned divans covered with his priceless rugs.
The <i>mézé</i>, or meal of hors d’œuvres, was served the
moment we arrived, with dainty dishes of fruit, cheese
and olives.</p>

<p class='c012'>The choirmaster of the Christian church had been
specially invited to bring his band for our benefit.
I found that, like so many of the Christians, even
the priests, he had scarcely any Armenian. Indeed,
they all wear the fez and speak of “our”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>country, “our” victories, and “our” ghazi Pasha!
It was in a Christian church that I once heard the
following prayer: “May the all powerful God bless
our beloved nation Turkey, and all the heroic sons and
children of this nation to which we are so proud to
belong. Give grace and health to our commander,
Mustapha Kemal Pasha the ghazi, and to all the
Ministers of the National Assembly, and all those who
have sacrificed their life and comfort for our welfare.”
The priest assured me that no one had “asked” him
to offer up any such prayer, which was the spontaneous
expression of his own feelings!</p>

<p class='c012'>All Armenians consider themselves “at home” in
Turkey; as the Welsh are “at home” in England.
About the same proportion know the language, the
national songs, history and literature, as we find in
Wales. The priest preaches in Turkish because he
desires the congregation to understand him; though,
if he knows Armenian, part of the Mass is said
in that language, for the sake of sentiment.</p>

<p class='c012'>In these days, of course, the races have been
provoked to mutual jealousies and suspicions. I
overheard greetings that certainly <i>sounded</i> like the
happy reunion of long-parted friends, and were, indeed,
accompanied by all the outward and visible signs
of affection, which the dignity of the European
must always suppress.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have missed you,” cried the affectionate
Turk; “life is not what it used to be. None of us can
take your place.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And the Armenian replied at once: “It was cruel
to turn us against you. Those horrible English—that
Lloyd George!”</p>

<p class='c012'>They spoke of the happy days when the Armenians
took care of Turkish children, whose parents had gone
on pilgrimage to Mecca. Now they have come back
the best of friends; and I believe, as they do, that
not even the English could ever separate them again.</p>

<p class='c012'>One of the guests, the Italian director of the Ottoman
Bank, was very anxious that Colonel Mougin
and I should not miss these signs of a permanent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>reconciliation. “You see,” he said, “it is only the
Turks themselves who can protect ‘minorities.’ It is
easy enough for any Armenian to get on with them.
The supposed antipathies are made in the States.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Governor-General of the Ottoman Bank, M.
Louis Steeg, also begged me to do all in my power
to stop this useless propaganda. The Armenians are
begging to be ‘left alone.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is manifest again that Mustapha Kemal includes
Christian minorities in the “New Turkey” he has
determined to save from veils, harems, and lattices;
the crumbling remains of Byzantium, anti-progressive
Hodjas, and the Byzantian Patriarch imposed on
Constantinople!</p>

<p class='c012'>Certainly these Christian musicians gave us
only Turkish music and songs: love songs, military
airs, the Moslem ‘Hymn of Independence’ (known to
every child in the land), Anatolian folk-songs, and,
most interesting and incomprehensible of all, the weird,
piping solo that accompanies the dancing dervishes,
a combination of sacred mystery, sentiment and
melancholy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Unfortunately, no European can expect to enter
fully into Turkish music without a good deal of study.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>And yet, deeply as I feel the charm of Eastern landscapes,
the glorious sunsets or brilliant sunshine
revealing white minarets against the black cypress,
I still hold dearer memories of the old talks with my
Turkish sister, beside the roseate mangal, as she
revealed to me the fascinating mysteries of the life
of the sons and daughters of her land.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is the same to-day in the more strenuous and,
in some respects, more Western atmosphere of the
proud National Assembly. Even if I have done but
little to convey the admiration their splendid resistance
demands, which I so strongly feel, the effort to
understand has brought me the greatest pleasure. And
whether or not I have earned, or merited, the joy, none
can take it from me.</p>

<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>ROME, THE ETERNAL CITY—A VISIT TO THE CATHOLICS IN ANGORA</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>There</span> is so often compensation for disappointment.
Had I been able to reach Angora through Constantinople,
had I not been held up six weeks by strikes on
sea, I should have missed the chance of another visit
to Rome—above all, of having an audience with Pope
Pius XI.</p>
<p class='c012'>His Holiness could not know, for I did not myself
then imagine, the precious gift he thus entrusted to
me for his children in Anatolia. He certainly would
not feel the time wasted, could I convey to him the
heartfelt joy and reverence with which they listened
for my answers to their eager questions. “What is
he like, our Holy Father? Is it true that he always
prays for us?”</p>

<p class='c012'>No one could fail, indeed, to have been impressed
by the deep sincerity with which the Pope takes
man’s sorrows to heart; the great anxiety that overwhelms
him, not only for his own flock but for all
humanity; and his great desire for peace.</p>

<p class='c012'>Towards Turkey, I believe the Christian world will
follow the lead of Great Britain; as in their attitude
towards the Christian Powers, Islam will follow the
lead of Turkey. Now that Mustapha Kemal Pasha
has raised Turkey again to be the true head of Islam,
should not our whole policy in the East rest on her
friendship?</p>

<p class='c012'>As in politics, so in religion. Dare we listen to the
appeal of American Nonconformity for a “Holy War”
<i>against</i> Islam; dare we follow the Anglican into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>union with the Greek Church <i>against</i> the followers of
the Prophet? Only the Roman Church has lived in
perfect harmony in Turkey? The only Christians to
praise and honour the Moslem faith!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>One must come from an audience in the Vatican
with sealed lips.</p>

<p class='c012'>But when humanity is waiting for understanding
and kindness; when, above all, the East is asking:
“Can we trust the West?” it is impossible to remain
altogether silent concerning the Holy Father of Rome.</p>

<p class='c012'>Turkey has been insulted, despised, and deceived
by Christendom. Despite her utmost tolerance to
every faith, she has been betrayed by those to whom
she was most indulgent. Missionaries she welcomed
in Christ’s name, as messengers of His love to all men,
have used their sacred privileges to organise enemy
propaganda.</p>

<p class='c012'>Therefore will I bear witness: there is a father’s
heart on Peter’s throne; a father anxious for all his
children, suffering; and <i>with no crusade to urge against
Islam</i>, also sons of God and brothers of Christ!
For him there is one “enemy,” and only one: the
“Materialism” that is poisoning our civilisations;
nourishing our pride, our jealousy, and our hate;
threatening our faith.</p>

<p class='c012'>Is this “indiscretion”? Yet how is it possible to
express one’s personal impressions of an audience with
the Sovereign Pontif! All the literatures of the
world have dedicated immortal pages to the Father
of Christendom. They have paid homage to him,
if not as spiritual head, at least as a great and
picturesque personality; and, above all, a personality
backed by the traditions of ages.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dumas, in his beautifully written interview with
Pope Gregory XVI., describes his terror at the thought
of meeting the Pope. To-day such a sentiment is no
longer possible. Awe and reverence have taken the
place of terror. Excommunication has lost all the
meaning it had in the Middle Ages. And yet, deprived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>as he is of all temporal power, the Pope is expected,
by virtue of the age of his sacred office, to express himself
in all moments of crisis. As spiritual head of the
Christian Church, he is to-day in a difficult position.
The Greeks and Armenians, it is true, are not for the
most part his children. They belong, however, to
branches of the Christian Church; and no Pope, however
much the poor misguided peoples are responsible
for their own misfortunes, can look with indifference
on what is happening to them, and may still happen.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, no Pope can forget what the
Vatican owes to Turkey. In that hospitable land, the
Roman Catholic orders, expelled from France, sought
refuge. Throughout the length and breadth of the
country, Catholic missions thrive and prosper. Though
they rarely, if ever, make converts, they give care in
sickness; comforts, education, and instruction to the
Turks. And who is responsible for the cultural French
language spoken in the Near East, if not the Jesuit
Fathers?</p>

<p class='c012'>This extraordinary religious tolerance on the part
of the Turks has always been incomprehensible.
Disraeli’s protection of the Turk was born of his gratitude
for the religious tolerance they extended to the
Jew. Jews, who could escape massacre in Russia,
found then, as they find now, a comfortable home
where they are free to practice their religion and make
money. What more can they want?</p>

<p class='c012'>Naturally, then, seeing what the Vatican owes to
Turkey, and Turkey to the Vatican, the Pope is interested
in the personality of M. Kemal Pasha, and
proved very willing to hear what a Western woman,
with opportunities in the past of studying Turkish
home life, knows of this great Nationalist hero.</p>

<p class='c012'>Anyone who has seen the ceremonies at the Vatican
must be impressed by their great spectacular beauty.
The Church of Rome has given the world some of its
finest art, literature and music. And at the Vatican
itself, wherever the eye wanders, there is beauty—beauty
of architecture, beauty of colouring. On the
one side there is the gaudy costume of the Swiss Guard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>with their scarlet and gold, in striking contrast to the
grey courtyard and the black dresses or mantillas of
the lady visitors; there are the frescoes, the statues:
and over all a veil of mystery and the charm of history.</p>

<p class='c012'>From the time one’s carriage rumbles over the
stones of the great unshaded courtyard to the side
where the Pope’s apartments are situated, one has the
sensation of walking over a book of sacred history.
It is true all Rome is history. The Vatican, however,
is the history of the Catholic Church from the
beginning, and as you go up the marble steps you instinctively
lower your voice, walking slowly and
silently. For have not all the greatest figures in the
world’s history passed up that staircase?</p>

<p class='c012'>There is everywhere a delightful odour of books;
but where are the books? Uniformed diplomatists,
high officials, generals, cardinals in their scarlet splendour,
priests in black and scarlet and purple, attendants
in red damask court breeches, walk noiselessly in and
out. All the chairs seem so big, and the consoles and
vases so huge and so valuable, that a portrait of the
kindly face of Pope Pius X. is a welcome change.
Seeing me looking at the peaceful, saintly face, my
neighbour whispers: “C’était un vrai père.” One
notices also a beautiful bust of Pope Benedict XV.
Why do the photographers never do justice to his fine
intelligent face?</p>

<p class='c012'>Monsignor X. has come to fetch me. He, too, is
keenly interested in Angora. Now I am taken to the
Throne Room; the Holy Father comes forward to
greet me. He stands whilst talking to me, with one
hand resting on a large piece of antique furniture.
Beginning to speak in English, he continues in French.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Pope speaks most modern languages; and,
as he receives every day, keeps himself in personal
touch not only with the best-known Catholics, but with
all the important personalities who come to Rome. He
has travelled extensively, is well-read in many languages,
and has written books of the highest value. As a
younger man, Monsignor Ceretti—the Paris Papal
Nonce—has told us, the Pope used often to read and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>write the whole night through, and he has an inexhaustible
fund of most valuable information. And
what does he not know of Islam? He has studied it
in all its phases; hence his great tolerance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Clad in a white cloth soutane, with a wide white
cape over his broad shoulders, a white cloth sash
hanging in wide ends on the left side, white buttons
and a white calotte and red shoes, the Holy Father
stands out as a contrast in simplicity to his surroundings.
His thick gold chain and handsomely chiselled
cross, with its large diamonds, are his only ornaments
besides the pastoral ring.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of medium height and pale, his powerful face is
young for his years, and his large wide forehead quite
unlined. His features are clear cut; his eyes seem small,
perhaps because of the thick glass of the spectacles,
which he frequently adjusts.</p>

<p class='c012'>One is particularly struck, however, by the power
of his features and his frank expression. It is a
face of much intelligence, but, above all, one of the
greatest human kindness. This can be seen more from
the mouth than the eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>I told the Pope why I was going to Angora, where,
as the people knew me and trusted me, I hoped, at any
rate, to achieve some good. An expression of infinite
sadness passed over his face as I continued: “All
this awful bloodshed, this useless suffering. Surely
these things should never have come upon us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>There was, indeed, little his Holiness could say.
He knows how useless it is now, to question on whose
shoulders History will place the responsibility for the
diplomatic bungling in the Near East.</p>

<p class='c012'>It should be remembered, however, that he had
written to M. Kemal, begging him to do all in his
power to prevent bloodshed as the army advanced.
The Pasha’s reply was dignified, wise, and sympathetic:
surely a key to his fine personality, as all can recognise
it to-day.</p>

<p class='c012'>I said to the Pope: “Mustapha Kemal appears
to me a man of great understanding, who would be
capable of a <i>beau geste</i> towards Christianity. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>speeches are democratic, full of kindness and consideration
for his people, revealing a real desire and
determination to lead them along the road to that
prosperity which should be the heritage of a people
dowered with a soil so fertile in precious minerals....
Yet, of course, other men in other countries have made
great speeches and done nothing!”</p>

<p class='c012'>In paying tribute to the personality of M. Kemal
Pasha, so far as I could then judge it, I said that he
seemed to me a man of moderation, who would always
use his great influence to prevent bloodshed. Yet
one trembles at the thought of the moment when the
army goes into Constantinople! The slightest friction,
through no fault of the great general himself,
might have appalling results. Yet I have sufficient
confidence in the Turks to know they would not
willingly harm one religious order. It could only
be by accident ... yet it would be terrible, and must
not happen....</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing will happen, your Holiness,” I went on,
“unless the Greeks begin it. In their tragic and
hasty exodus from Thrace were they not reminded,
in terror of what might be, of their own conduct in
Asia Minor?” Yet the Pope’s face was very anxious.
There was great pathos in his voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>In what almost tragic situations a Pope thus often
finds himself! The spiritual father of both sides;
nevertheless neutral, or, if not neutral, criticised by
both ... always expected to dispense generosity and
mercy—and receiving none; no wonder the strain of
the war killed both Benedict XV. and Pius X.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Angora I told M. Kemal Pasha of the Pope’s
great desire for peace. What was to be the Pasha’s
<i>beau geste</i> towards Christianity. I suggested he might,
as S. Sophia was a Christian Church, give it back to the
Pope, as spiritual head of Christendom.</p>

<p class='c012'>M. Kemal Pasha replied: “Had there been only
one branch of the Christian Church, although S.
Sophia has now become part of our Moslem traditions,
it might have been possible. As the Christian Church
is so much divided, it is impossible. We should only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>excite the Russians, the Greeks, and the Anglicans,
to come and fight each other on our soil for S. Sophia;
and the <i>beau geste</i> you suggest for peace would lead
to eternal conflict and strife. Nevertheless, we are so
anxious to do all in our power to honour Christianity
in the eyes of the world that if, by our retaining S.
Sophia as a mosque, we are really giving offence to
the Catholic Church, we would either turn it into a
museum, or close it forever. None must ever be able
to say that we have intentionally injured the Christian
Church.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I complimented the Pasha on his fine sentiments
toward the Christian religion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is natural,” he replied. “I am only carrying on
our traditional tolerance to all religions. The Roman
Catholics and all Christians, as well as the Jews, have
always had full religious freedom in our country.</p>

<p class='c012'>As to the <i>beau geste</i>, what can I say? You are free
to go anywhere you like in Anatolia; talk to the
Greeks, talk to the Armenians. If there is any cause
of complaint, we will see that it is removed
at once. We want the Christians to be happy
in our country. We have given them full religious
liberty, and equal rights with Moslems: can we do
more? I feel sure that, in spite of all the devastation
and atrocities committed by the Greeks in our
country, in a very short time they will be back
amongst us: the great friends they were before the
Powers interfered.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Rauf Bey, the Prime Minister, echoed the sentiments
of the Pasha. “Tell the Pope,” he said, “to
rest assured we are doing all in our power to make his
people happy and contented. Can there be a finer
<i>beau geste</i> than this?”</p>

<p class='c012'>As the Pasha had suggested, I went everywhere,
saw and questioned everyone. The Greek prisoners
were bitter in their criticism of England, who
betrayed them and left them unaided to fight the
Turkish army. Surely the least intelligent of our
military attachés would have seen the cruelty of such
a move.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Contrary to what most people suppose, there is a
Christian colony left in Angora. It is mostly Armenian,
though there are still many Greeks. The community
nevertheless calls itself, and always gives as its legal
nationality, “Catholic”; a delicate way of avoiding
difficult questions.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mass is said on Sunday three times, partly in Armenian,
which many of the Armenians do not understand,
and the rest in Turkish. All the Armenians
wear fezes, and prayers are said for Turkey. The
little chapel is primitive and picturesque; never,
however, has one heard such strange <i>Ave Marias</i> or
<i>Glorias</i> or <i>Agnus Deis</i> as those sung in their Turkish
setting.</p>

<p class='c012'>During my Christmas visit to the head of the
Armenian Church at Angora, I asked him what message
he wished me to give the Pope on his behalf. I told
him the Pope was anxious about the Christians; and
he might tell me, in confidence, if he was not happy
in Turkey.</p>

<p class='c012'>For my visit the Armenian orphans had put their
home in <i>festere altere</i>. They had made cakes and
sweets to be served with coffee and tea.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then it was that I had the pleasure of speaking
to them about the wonderful personality of the Pope
as I had seen him in Rome; and of telling them that,
above all, their Father in Christ stood for loyalty to
their State. The Turks had never hampered their
loyalty to their Church, and the Pope would never
hamper the loyalty and obedience they owed to the
Sovereign State.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then the dusky-skinned orphans, boys and girls
together, were marched before me, each taking my
hand, kissing it and raising it to their forehead.</p>

<p class='c012'>As I said afterwards to Colonel Mougin: “I wish
it were possible to supplement the meagre funds with
which Father Babadjanian is maintaining this little
colony of poor children.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell the Holy Father,” said Father Babadjanian,
“that we are <i>perfectly</i> happy with the Turks. They are
trying to send us away from Angora for economical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>reasons, but we do not want to go. We have been
told by the Grand National Assembly that we shall
have exactly the same rights as the Moslems—no
more, no less. What more can we expect or
desire?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell His Holiness to inform Europe and America,”
he concluded, “that it is useless to try and protect
<i>disloyal</i> Christian minorities here. It cannot be done
by any Church, or any League of Nations. We know
very well, and events have proved it, that so long as
we remain <i>loyal</i> to the Turkish Government, all will
be well. All the trouble that has come to us has
arisen from the disloyalty and political intrigues of
the Orthodox Armenians and Greeks, and, above
all, from outside propaganda. So much has been
said and written about an “Armenian Home”; let
America offer Armenians that national home. Let
the Powers, since it is they who are the cause of all
the trouble, only recognise that they must provide
homes elsewhere for every Christian who wants to go,
or else leave us alone....</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you only knew how we tremble before this
useless propaganda, how we pray to be delivered from
our European friends. <i>Turkey is our home.</i> We have
to live with the Turks on friendly terms; and will
gladly do so, if <i>only</i> this political propaganda can
cease.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Colonel Mougin, who accompanied me on this
visit, can vouch for these statements, which he considered
so important that he communicated them to
his Government.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have delivered the message of M. Kemal Pasha
and Father Babadjanian to the Holy Father. He
will receive, also, fuller impressions of my interesting
trip through Anatolia; and fuller descriptions of
this country and those people who have made so
splendid a fight for freedom and independence.</p>

<p class='c012'>Throughout the length and breadth of Anatolia,
prayers for peace have been echoed and re-echoed.
There must be peace; but not at the expense of the
sovereign rights of the people.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>It is a comfort to the Turks, nevertheless, to know
that the head of the Catholic Church stretches out
the hand of friendship towards them, and prays for
their peace and prosperity through the brotherhood
of Moslems and Christians in the East.</p>

    <div>THREE DIPLOMATS AT ROME—THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE HOLY TOMB</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>In</span> Rome I met three diplomats; as different from each
other as night from day, as the Pope of Rome from the
Khalif of Islam—a false comparison often made in
New Turkey to-day.</p>
<p class='c012'>We have described the Pope; the sanctity of his
office, the odour of piety in which he dwells. The Pope
is not of the world; he is above the world-elected,
not born. The Khalif, like an hereditary king, inherits
his position as Head of Islam; which means
that he owes his position to the hazard of fortune, not
to personality or virtue.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have met all the Khalifs from Abdul Hamid to
his present descendant, who was, when I saw him, the
third in succession. He appeared to me a kindly,
cultured gentleman and a talented artist. My host
at that time, Prince Youssouff Zeddine, heir to the
then Sultan, had frequently invited me to the Palace,
and always spoke highly of his younger brother. The
Prince had a touching affection for England, and, with
Djémal Pasha (then Minister of Marine) for interpreter,
would gladly listen to endless stories of olden and
modern days. Passing from Alfred and the cakes;
through Drake, Gordon, and Princess Mary; to his
favourite tale of the Suffragettes chained to the grille
at Westminster, I sought to inspire this unhappy man
with memories of the greatness of the England he
loved so well.</p>

<p class='c012'>If, by any chance, I varied a phrase or omitted the
slightest detail, he would beg Djémal “to respectfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>remind Mademoiselle that she is going too fast!”
It is difficult, indeed, to believe that the man who
laughed so heartily at the words “Votes for Women,”
could have ended his own existence. He dared to
say to the Turkish Parliament, “On no account must
we be on the wrong side with England”; and the next
day he was dead!</p>

<p class='c012'>Not only in Turkey, but throughout Islam, which
includes India, there is no institution so sacred as the
Khalifate, yet the term is meaningless if the Khalif
loses Arabia. Next in sanctity to Mecca, in Moslem
eyes, comes Jerusalem, for all the prophets of that
Holy City are sacred to Islam, though her prophets
have no honour in Judea or among Christians. Should
we not tremble when Christian Powers attempt to
tamper with lands of pilgrimage like Hedjaz, and when
they trample upon the traditions of the Khalifate?</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>At Rome, Osman Nyzami Pasha represented Constantinople,
while Djelaleddine Arif Bey was Minister
for Angora. The former did not, indeed, go into exile
with the Nationalists; but his varied experience as
soldier, statesman, and ambassador has given him a
rare knowledge of Europe that makes him popular
and useful in diplomacy. Alas, now, however, his
career ends.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ten years ago in Constantinople he greeted me
with, “Dear child, what for did you do this dreadful
thing,” as I was returning from the Persian Mouharrem,
the anniversary of the assassination of Hussein,
son of the Prophet. The Spanish Minister, who was
with us, had fainted outright, although familiar with
bull-fights. His wife, Mme. M., a Swede, had more
courage than either of us; but I almost fell into the
Ambassador’s arms as I reached my hotel.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a ring formed round a centre of blazing torches,
white-robed men wail and mourn for the holy martyr,
slashing their heads with swords. They dip their
hands in the flowing blood, and sprinkle it all over
their faces. I was haunted for weeks by the ghastly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>spectacle, which I shall never be able to forget, of
those stained robes and faces, amidst the wild fanatical
shrieks. When, as often happens, a man thus kills himself
in the fury of exaltation, he is acclaimed a martyr,
and his family are pensioned for life.</p>

<p class='c012'>When I asked why such awful ceremonies were
permitted, I was reminded of Turkey’s “non-interference”
with every creed and all the “pieties” of all
peoples.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>At Rome, I lodged in a quiet convent, which closed
at 7.30. But the Ambassador called at eight and was
followed by a succession of Turkish friends, until
Mihrinour and her husband arrived at 10.30. I
apologised next morning to the Mother Superior for
such unseemly interruptions of her ordered life;
explaining, in a fifteen minutes’ lecture, how anxious
a Turk would always feel for the comfort of any friend.
“You are perfectly right,” she said, “I know them
well. I lived eighteen years on the shores of the
Bosphorus!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Djelaleddine Arif Bey gave me a right royal welcome
to Rome, and allowed me to trouble him with all
sorts of questions. In Constantinople he had been
what we call Dean of the Faculty of Law, and one day,
on an official visit to the Sultan, wearing a frock-coat
and patent-leather shoes, <i>he had just time to escape to
Angora</i>, dressed as he was. His knowledge of both the
Cheriat and European Laws was invaluable to the
Assembly, and it is a delight to hear from his own lips
that Turkey is going to establish her <i>own</i> Constitution,
not a poor imitation of ours.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Our justice has been paralysed by capitulations,”
he said; and told me of an Italian murderer who had
found sanctuary in his Consulate, because the Kavass
would not give him up. “We have been bound and
fettered all these years, but it cannot go on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>His admirable organisation of Justice in Angora
developed from one colleague to twenty-five assistants,
for work which occupied three hundred men in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Constantinople! Yet he very soon established complete
order, though after the peace he hopes for still greater
perfection.</p>

<p class='c012'>He was interested in the personality of Cardinal
Gasparri, whom I had met for the first time. I found
him a great contrast to Cardinal Merry de Val, with
whom I had long discussions about Islam ten years ago.</p>

<p class='c012'>Shrewdest of diplomats, keenest of observers, is
there one move of the world’s political chess-board
he has not penetrated? Seeing, knowing, judging
everything, could he make a mistake? In a State
Church he would be a grave danger; but the days of
State Churches are almost no more. As the Turkish
minister remarked: “A Church needs more than anything
a level-headed diplomatist having no connection
with politics.” The Cardinal, then, is far too clever
a man to undervalue Islam.</p>

<p class='c012'>He has studied the greatest living authorities, in
translations when he cannot read the originals, upon
all the wonderful books of the East, and listens to men
learned in the Koran. In theology, as in politics,
none could catch him napping. One may, perhaps,
guess something of his opinions by listening carefully
to such questions as he may put to you; for he tells
you nothing and seems to gather up all you know
almost before you are conscious of having spoken. I
<i>do</i> remember, however, that he asked me what the
Turks proposed to do about the Holy Tomb?</p>

<p class='c012'>To this I answered that Djelaleddini Arif Bey had
said: “There could be no decision taken about Palestine
without consulting the Turks. This astute lawyer
had always bidden the Catholic authorities to remember
that Christ, according to the Koran, is of miraculous
birth, is one of Islam’s most venerated prophets.
For the Moslem to blaspheme the Virgin Mary would
be a heinous offence. To hand over the guardianship
of the Holy Tomb to the Israelites is, therefore, a
direct insult to Islam.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Fethi Bey also said: “We have all our work cut
out looking after our own frontiers, yet we have always
faithfully guarded the tomb of Christ, our prophet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>What can we think, if the Powers now prefer to entrust
it to the Jews who crucified Him and still deny Him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Even as Mecca is to the Moslem, should Calvary be
to us. Shall we who are called Christians suffer the
Tomb we do not guard ourselves, to be taken from
those who have faith in Christ?</p>

    <div>EN ROUTE FOR CONSTANTINOPLE—A NIGHT AT BILIDJIK UNDER THE FROST-LADEN SKIES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>One</span> does not expect comfort in an unheated railway
carriage, with snow a foot and a half deep, and the
temperature 15° below zero. As we left Angora we
also noticed that one of the carriage windows was
missing, and a courteous official kept back the train
to insert one from another compartment! We were
grateful, indeed, for even then the cold was hard to
bear.</p>
<p class='c012'>The little engine is now ploughing its way <i>downhill</i>
but still slowly, since halts are needed to renew its
strength for the double task of “traction” and sweeping
away the snow.</p>

<p class='c012'>We are well supplied with food for a five-days’
journey, so that over a cheerful meal we can almost
forget to feel frozen, and soon find we have covered
the thirty-five hours to Eski-Chéir.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Eski-Chéir to Kada-Keuy, where the lines
have been cut, is a short distance; but, mercifully, it is
not so cold as in the mountains. From there we travel
in a yaili (native carriage) which has evidently seen
better days and, let us hope, better springs. They
have been removed altogether from one side, and we
should have been easier without the worn remnants
on the other! As there are no seats, one
has to be propped up by any available rugs or
cushions, unless you prefer lying down at full length.
But the little cart is lined with red-cotton brocade,
while green curtains, looking-glasses, and tassels complete
the “decoration”! It must be delightful to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>saunter along on a summer’s day; and draw your
curtains for a night in the open; but even the straw,
the mattress, and many rugs cannot transform the
yaili to a <i>train de luxe</i> in winter.</p>

<p class='c012'>To catch “the express” at Bilidjik we have to
drive in two and a half hours a distance that requires a
much longer time. So, with good horses and a
fearless driver, we rattle away, up hill and down, over
bumps and stones. The luggage is thrown out, my
thermos is shaken to pieces, and we are flung violently
against the roof! Bruised and bleeding, we hold on
in grim silence; since time, too, flies.</p>

<div id='i255'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i255.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Yaili, or Native Carriage, with Drawn Curtains.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Even at this pace we cannot escape the oppression
of desolation. On every side lie smashed engines,
burnt railway carriages, and villages in cinders.
As dusk falls, only a fatalist, in a country of fatalists,
could venture the rush down sharp descents cut
through a precipice of 800 feet!</p>

<p class='c012'>Fate, indeed, preserved us, only to prove its irony;
for when we reached the once prosperous Bilidjik,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>still beautiful in its ruins, we hear that a landslip on
the line has made traffic impossible for some days to
come. In Anatolia, one must be ready to do as the
Anatolians; and we are faced with the prospect of a
night under the frost-laden skies. There is not even
a chair to be found, though “kindness” quickly
contrives a seat for me from a pile of logs. Here I
can rest awhile; and by brisk walks at short intervals
probably keep up my circulation until the
welcome dawn....</p>

<p class='c012'>Someone, however, suggested that we should beg
for shelter in one of the luggage-vans already crowded
with men and women—naturally, in separate compartments.
One thought of the poor villagers we had seen
huddled together in their holes on the mountains;
and realised that even the floor of a luggage-van may
be a “luxury.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Here turban-headed men are sitting on their
prayer-carpets, some sound asleep in that uncomfortable
attitude, others eating, and others praying,
but none uttering a word of complaint.</p>

<p class='c012'>Looking around for a seat amidst the wilderness
of food and bed-clothes, I suddenly hear a few cheery
words in English, to my amazement and delight.
Here is one of the American Relief Workers, prepared
and thankful to spend the night among the strange
crowd. With the resourcefulness of his nation, he
is provided with a large hat-box that will serve as seat
or table, and contains both food and bed-clothes. From
his “seat,” therefore, he quickly extracts some sandwiches
of most delicious pea-nut butter, making a cup
of tea for me on his “table.”</p>

<p class='c012'>All eyes are drawn to the neat dispatch of these
preparations and the marvellous ingenuity of his
packing. From that veritable box of Pandora came
solid alcohol, tins, kettles, goblets and card-board
plates. The food itself was kept in clean, little linen
bags.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was, indeed, a strange lesson in efficiency and
practical hygiene, delivered in the wilderness! His
unpractical, Eastern neighbour is meanwhile struggling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>with a bit of old newspaper, from which a most unappetising
collection of honey and eggs and nuts and
bread are tumbling in dirty confusion, as the broken
eggs and printer’s ink trickle in a discoloured stream
on the floor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If only you would send out a good company of
missionaries in hygiene,” I cried out, in my excitement,
“the other gospels would follow as a matter of
course. The world will be a far better place
when America comes to the East and preaches the
need for exterminating the house-fly and other insects
with the fine zeal she is now devoting to the extermination
of the Turk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>My new friend—I had almost said compatriot—laughs
good-naturedly at my enthusiasm; and in a
few moments, despite my sympathy with Anatolia,
I am again compelled to recognise that I am, after all,
a woman of the West.</p>

<p class='c012'>When someone brought in a blazing mangal and
carefully closed every door of the crowded luggage-van,
the American soon found a polite excuse to jump
out. Five minutes later I, too, ventured to open the
door and call out to ask him for a helping hand.
Both of us knew it was far better for us to die of cold
in the fresh air than to choke in those thick charcoal
fumes. I will hold a light while he digs out a hole,
for sleep on the bosom of Mother Earth.</p>

<p class='c012'>But now two charming Turkish boys, the sons of
Moueddine Pasha, in our party, are telling me that they
are terribly distressed at my discomfort. It is in vain for
me to assure them that no one could blame <i>them</i>. Somehow,
they find the <i>Commandant de la place</i>; and, at
his direction, gallantly tramp back for two and a half
hours, to bring me a mattress from the Governor’s
house which, placed on three standard oil-boxes, forms
my bed. Meanwhile, the Commandant, who is familiar
with Europe and speaks fluent German, earnestly begs
me to excuse this terrible reception. “It is the
work of Lloyd George,” he adds, as for every disaster
in Anatolia the same cause is proclaimed. Ask a
peasant who killed his sons, and he will reply without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>hesitation, “Lloyd George.” Our late Premier has
now become super-bogeyman of the Near East for
Moslems and Christians alike.</p>

<p class='c012'>All through the night strains break on my ears of the
Anatolian folk-songs; the expression of that strangely
resigned happiness of a long-suffering people which we of
the West must half-envy and, at the same time, half-despise.
Average human nature is only too apt to
neglect those who never complain; and if others
appeal for them, to say—as even America has said—“It
is too big a problem for us to tackle.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With so much goodwill around me, the night passed
far more quickly than even my natural optimism
could have foretold. And before stepping into the
yaili that will carry us on to Broussa, I try to express
to the kindly peasants a little of the gratitude and
admiration in my heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We do not lack anything,” they assure me.
“All we want is to save our Fatherland. It would be
wrong of us to use up the wood and material for building
houses that may be required in the war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, for farewell, the old Bible-greeting of
“God be with you.”... “And bring us peace,” is
all I can find voice to reply.</p>

    <div>FROM BILIDJIK TO BROUSSA BY YAILI—AFTER THE DAY’S ROUGHENING EXPERIENCES ONE CAN SLEEP WHATEVER THE ACCOMMODATION.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Our</span> adieux to Bilidjik did not delay us long. As
there were no trains to Constantinople, we had to take
the road to Broussa and Moudania, whence the
boat runs to Constantinople. I now joined the
American in one carriage, the two Turkish boys following
in a second. Although <i>yaili</i> means “a carriage
with springs,” neither of ours justified their name, for
they had none. An American, however, is nothing if
not resourceful, and my companion performed
wonders with straw, rugs, and boxes.</p>
<p class='c012'>It was about nine o’clock when we started along
the muddy roadway, in charge of one of the most
happy-go-lucky coachmen it has ever been my good
fortune to employ. He had ten animals of his own
before the war, and, now the Greeks have taken them
all, he is making a fresh start with the best he can
hire from others. He <i>said</i> that these were steady and
sound, but I could not believe we should have known
the difference, over these ploughed fields on the edge
of the mountains, so caked with mud that our carriages
frequently stuck fast. It was a wearisome business
enough, the constant alighting to be dug out for
fresh starts; but I was altogether beyond sharing the
American’s alarm lest we should sink for ever in a bog!
I was far more concerned about the difficulty of getting
really comfortable, among my disordered rugs and
shawls.</p>

<p class='c012'>As our coachman provides us with many evidences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>of Greek barbarity from the ruins of every village we
pass, my companion’s indignation shows rapid signs
of approach to fever heat. “We’ve not played
‘straight,’” he cried, “I am not pro-Greek nor pro-Turk,
and, at the moment, I haven’t much use for
Christians; but I don’t see myself keeping quiet
about all this. You and I have to get quick and
publish a little truth for a change.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I told him that I had been trying in vain to get
something done, or at least known, about Angora;
but that if ever an article of mine included a word
about Greek atrocities, the editorial scissors promptly
got busy, and the truth remained untold.</p>

<p class='c012'>Obviously the American belonged to that fine type,
which abounds in young countries, who put all their
dollars into the acquisition of knowledge, and who
delight in using the knowledge they have acquired,
backed by their own wealth, in the service of mankind.
His keen inquiries about <i>my</i> impressions of the sad
people he had come so far to understand, were proof
enough that no kind of vanity, or pursuit of self-glorification,
lay behind his insatiable curiosity.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was much interested to find that he agreed with
me in having noticed how strongly the “personal”
element enters into all one’s relations with any Turk.
If they do not like one, you might as well stay in England.
If your personality attracts them, it will
make no difference where you happen to have been born.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are called ignorant and fanatical; but I
find that even the most illiterate understand enough
of our civilisation to make any honest Englishwoman
heartily ashamed of our ignorance and insularity.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Remember,” he said, “how little we Americans
really know of you, or you of us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I <i>do</i> remember how I shocked one of your compatriots
by confessing that I had the most shaky idea
of the occasion for your ‘Thanksgiving,’ but he afterwards
admitted he had imagined till quite recently,
that ‘Boxing Day’ was the annual event of our
national sport!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>There was little to break the monotony of our
lonely journey except a large number of caravans,
and, every now and again, one of those tiny little donkeys,
used to lead a troop of from nine to fifteen camels!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now you see,” said the ‘man from the States,’
“why we sometimes speak of a ‘conceited ass!’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Only,” I answered, “this little fellow has something
to be conceited about. He has the right to
say ‘look at me,’ as he trots along with the double row
of turquoise beads round his neck, leading these great
big chaps behind him. When he chooses to push
ahead, they must hurry after him; and when he condescends
to turn round and ‘look over’ them, for all
the world as an officer might ‘eye’ his men, you
could not discover a more striking example of personality
in the East. I declare I have fallen in love with
that charming ass!”</p>

<div id='i261'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i261.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“He has the right to say, ‘Look at me.’”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Very well,” he replied with a laugh, “the next
time anyone calls me an ‘ass,’ I shall be proud to accept
the compliment.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“But, seriously,” I replied, “asses are seldom as
black as they’re painted. After all, to be stubborn
is one form of personality. I remember staying in a
French chateau during the war, where one donkey
had taken over the duties and responsibilities of the
eighteen horses, which had been requisitioned by the
State. On Sundays, tied up to a tree in the churchyard,
while the family was inside the church, he always
waited to hear the Sanctus bell, and then brayed his
loudest. He must take part in the Mass!”</p>

<p class='c012'>One rarely sees any driver astride his camel.
He may be “considering his beast,” but, on the other
hand, he may not. For of every variety of sickness
(of the sea, the home, or love itself) is not camel-sickness
the worst?</p>

<p class='c012'>My companion agreed that he had not found the
Turks either stubborn or unreasonable. “Everyone
I met in Anatolia made an honest attempt to understand
my point of view, even when I endeavoured to
explain or at least to excuse, English policy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Turks are ‘stubborn,’ if you insist on the phrase,
about the future of their country; but they have given
a great deal of thought to the subject, and they speak
from experience that has been bought at a big price.
I have never encountered that uncomfortable type of
mind we know so well among ourselves, and in a more
aggressive, if less dangerous, form in the States, which
nothing will move from its ‘pet’ hatred or chosen
love, <i>in spite of</i> great culture and general understanding.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will not quote President Wilson, because we have
an even better illustration in the late Lord Bryce. Few
men could claim wider culture, few have been so
universally acknowledged a great statesman, yet the
Turk to him was no better than a red rag to a bull!
And when he said that these people were ‘unspeakable,’
the world believed it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I once attended a debate on whether ‘the Turks
should, or should not, be forced to abandon Constantinople.’
A judge from Constantinople had been
called to open the discussion, who said, among other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>things, that ‘this eternal reference to India as an
excuse for backing Turkey was mere nonsense; <i>because
Lord Bryce had said that India was indifferent to Turkey’s
fate</i>!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Seyed Hossain, a member of the Khaliphat Delegation,
then rose to contradict this assertion. He
said that he had come all the way from India with the
Khaliphat Delegation, for the express purpose of protesting
against the attitude of the Allies towards <i>his</i>
Khaliph (the Sultan of Turkey).”</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘My dear Sir,’ answered the judge, ‘I have
absolutely full confidence in any statement made by
Lord Bryce.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“The poor Indian was staggered for a moment,
but soon found courage to reply: ‘Has a man like
Lord Bryce the <i>right</i> to defy commonsense, statistics,
and accurate, official information. My presence here
is a clear proof that my statement is correct.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Your presence means nothing to me,’ was the
‘polite’ retort, which concluded the debate!</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is, of course, a very stupid kind of loyalty
in such an attitude, but it tempts one to almost despair
of ever hoping to fight against its criminal injustice
to Turkey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a heavy responsibility for great men if
they give rein to an obstinate and unreasonable prejudice.
It is so hard to resist those we respect.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>“What do you really think about the Americans
in Turkey? I am so anxious to do my utmost for
these poor people, asked my friend.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I, who love them, will honestly say I fear that
the influence of your people is very dangerous. For
<i>one</i> who does good, as I am sure you have done, there
are fifty who only make mischief, even undoing much
of what you have achieved.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The supreme merit of the Nationalist movement
comes from the fact that Turks are beginning to be
<i>themselves</i>. All must be well in the end if they are
content to ‘swallow’ Europe in small doses. Already
we have with us that dangerous anomaly the European
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Turk. The big capitals kill his sincerity and capture
his affections by their vices. His mysterious dark eyes
(an everyday commonplace in his own country) too
often prove ‘false lights’ leading him on to the rocks.
It is a test of character to ask the European Turk if
he is not ‘longing to get back to Turkey?’ When I
put the question to Hussein Raghib, he said ‘if I must
stay here for my country, I will stay, but I am never
happy for long so far away from Angora and all it
means to me.’ Certainly a healthy view!</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is surely better to let the Turks work out their
own salvation, only helping when they ask for help;
and even then we should be careful to give them what
they desire and not what <i>we</i> may think best for them.
It is really cruel to tamper with other people’s ideas,
particularly their religion, and it does no good in
Turkey. The gospel of Islam has made them the
fine race they will always remain at heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You can do good in practical, material affairs
and for the diminution of physical suffering. I wish
every American would preach the gospel of the Rockefeller
Institute all over the world: the creed of the
open window, a crusade against vermin and microbes.
That would bring us a ‘new’ world.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I would like to see a closer union between the
Red Cross and the Red Crescent. The Turks have
not your organising ability; but they have many
sound ideas already operating in their hospitals.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must be quite sure that our civilisation is
perfect before we force it on others. It is ‘mine,’
and I owe much to it; but I, for one, can see much
to criticise.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I, too, believe we have no right to offer more
than material assistance, and such an example as our
own efforts, towards the best we know, may afford.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is a great deal, if given in the right spirit. My
own idea of ‘service’ is to try and understand the
East, to prevent such terrible blunders as our ignorance
of them have brought about, which may even involve
us in the horrors of another war.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why should we ask Orientals to accept our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>civilisation and ‘look at life’ through our eyes. It is
no wiser or juster than asking a woman to see nothing
except through a man’s eyes; and to work in his way.
She cannot do that, and has suffered in the attempt.
Your work is even a great peril. It is only too probable
that you will be ‘starting’ them on the wrong
road, and you must soon leave them to find their
own way.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If I am wrong, at least I speak in all sincerity;
and I have studied the question for many years. As
I see it, our Western civilisations have much to learn
from the East in pity and humanity.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Osman Nyzami Pasha said to me once, in Rome,
‘you must not judge a nation by its Government
but by the gods it creates for itself in its own image.’
The ancient Greeks peopled Olympus with gods of
revolting immorality; but you in Oxford forget that
chapter of the story. The God of the North——”</p>

<p class='c012'>He paused, and I took up the challenge.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The cold, harsh, and unforgiving Deity; the
bogeyman of my childhood, always ready with some
awful punishment for the least shortcoming.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why are our Puritan countries, whose God is
love, so unjust to women, keeping them down under
cruel and illogical laws. It is idle for men to say that
no laws can diminish the deep respect they accord
to women, which, in fact, is seldom shown to any of
us except their wives, certainly not to woman as a
woman.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I certainly hold no brief for ‘irregularity,’ but
there is something wrong with a conception of God
which has produced the immeasurable gulf between
the married and the unmarried mother. Humanity
is not of our making; the ‘imperfect’ man has no
right to demand ‘perfection’ from all women. Has he
not made and tolerated <i>War</i> that has overthrown
every standard of morality, changed all our ‘values,’
shattered every ideal, leaving religion nowhere, and
two million women without a mate?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Such is the civilisation that dares to point a
finger of scorn at the unmarried mother; and, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>dismissing her, characterless and unpensioned, from
every respectable avenue of support, dares to brand
a child as unwanted, and push the innocent young
life into secret and shameful surroundings. Those
who should help, with all the power of their sheltered
purity, prefer to keep themselves ‘too respectable for
any knowledge of these uncomfortable problems,’
since they are good and faithful servants of One who
said, ‘Let him who is without sin amongst you cast the
first stone!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“All maternity is sacred to the Turk, and every
child enjoys full legal status. The super-cowardice
of declaring a child as born of ‘parents unknown’
(as you may in France) could never be allowed. If
marriage be not the high sacrament it is, theoretically,
regarded in Europe, the life of <i>every babe</i>
whom God sends us is held to be a sacred charge. Do
our missionaries in Turkey really preach the Gospel of
Christ?”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>“Do you approve, or admire, the resignation of
the East, the Turk’s ideal of being content with so
little?” asked the energetic American.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are <i>both</i> wrong. Their resignation too often
leaves life stagnant, our race for dollars drenches the
world in blood.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it not horrible for us to have to confess that
all this appalling Battle of the Cross against the
Crescent, sprang out of greed for oil.</p>

<p class='c012'>“One cannot realise what the world would be like
were all nations governed by your and my ideals.
Would there ever have been a British Empire? We
can scarcely justify, on grounds of high morality, the
conquest of America; and, surely, the States could
by such ruling have, indeed, become ‘God’s own
country.’”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>When the road became rather more European,
our Turkish boy friends sought to relieve the monotony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>by a furious race between the two yailis, and we
were tossed about beyond all possibility of further
talk. When, however, the boys had won the first
heat, I begged to be excused from trying to secure
our revenge, as the carriages did not seem solid
enough for racing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then behold, at the word, one of our wheels flew
off! And, though we were mercifully taking a saunter
“between rounds” at the moment, we had to follow
our belongings into the mud and do what we could
to help the wheelwright.</p>

<p class='c012'>The American, I found, had been teaching himself
the language, and claims to have read <i>Nasreddin Hodja</i>
in the original. Now he hastened to improve the
occasion by the most voluble congratulations to our
unmoved drivers. “This wheel evidently knew how
to choose the ‘psychological moment’ for its detachment,”
he exclaimed. “On the edge of a mountain,
we should all have been pitched into the depths;
crossing a river, our lady passenger, who cannot swim,
would have been drowned; during the race, we could
not have avoided a fatal collision. If it had to happen,
it could not have happened more wisely!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The job is finished at last; maybe hastened by
such lively chatter; but I confess we did not feel
really secure. In fact, the prudent suggestion that
one of us should hold the reins while our driver “kept
an eye on” the wheel was soon justified by a second
flying away of that “offending member.” It was this
time discovered that something must be found to
enlarge the circumference of the axle to keep it fixed,
and I immediately offered my pocket-handkerchief.
Our driver, however, would not hear of “depriving me”
and so I begged the American “not to disturb him,
but to see how he would contrive.” Though obviously
puzzled for a few minutes, he soon justified my confidence
by cutting off a good handful of hair from
the horse’s mane, and thus “fixing” the wheel once
more.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s all very ingenious,” laughed my companion,
“but ‘hair’ won’t ‘wear.’”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Then he’ll find something just as original,” was
my triumphant retort.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless it was growing dark, and there were
rivers ahead that would seem to demand rather better
security than we possessed. My anxieties, however,
were soon scattered to the four winds by the most
astonishing tirade of unjust contempt for all things
English, in which my companion now proceeded to
indulge. My anger lasted just long enough for us
to cross the river; for once we were over, the good
man explained that he’d done it to make me
furious, the only way he knew to cure a brave woman’s
fit of nerves.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>At last the welcome smoke, rising from peat
cottage-fires, brings the comforting knowledge that
we have almost reached Enichéir; and we are soon
happily searching for some sort of a resting place that
may call itself “an inn.” We are offered the choice
of four beds in a room with five others already occupied,
or an empty, partially wrecked, sleeping apartment
containing two!—one for me, one for the boys, and
the American on the floor.</p>

<p class='c012'>We naturally accept the latter, and immediately
get busy about some cooking and a wash. After
the day’s roughening experiences one can sleep
whatever the details of the accommodation!</p>

<p class='c012'>At about 9.30 that evening we are awakened
by the police, who, however, explain that I am
only “wanted” by the Commandant, who has called
to wish me <i>bon voyage</i>, and inquire if there is anything
he can do for my comfort or to speed me on the way.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is not now the Pasha and four wives,” said I,
as our visitor soon discreetly left us, “but the Englishwoman
and three husbands!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Next morning after a pleasant hour of mutual
assistance in heating the water and holding a
looking-glass for each other, with, as I told them,
“the most courtly assistants any woman could desire,”
the American goes out in order to fix that wheel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>to his own satisfaction and, by inference, to mine.
We have two more days in the yailis and cannot afford
to lose time.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our next halting-place is still more primitive, with
its four houses, the tiny inn, a large stable, and a
poultry yard. Here, however, the Mayor is ready to
join us, in his long Persian shawl, robe, and turban, his
documents wrapped in a case of flannel. Like the driver,
I notice that, as he steps into his seat, he is careful
to take off his muddy shoes. Indeed, the godly cleanliness
of Islam, if it does not quite follow our Western
traditions, is a very real and honest ideal. The body,
as the cheik had assured me, is clean if the clothes
be dirty; and I am beginning to think that those
“little visitors” in the hotel beds must really be
“suffered in kindness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I well remember the shock with which one of my
friends met the suggestion that he might drown some
of the kittens who were arriving, just then, with most
alarming rapidity. He said, “the Koran would not
permit it!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Another weary day, amidst so much mud and so
many ruins, naturally stirs my companion to thoughts
of what might be done by a few dollars.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do not mind your having any concessions,” I
said, “if you will keep your hands off the architecture.
I was hearing the other day about a scheme for
building a railway in co-operation with the Turks:
one rail to be laid by them and the other by the Americans!
I should feel far more safe in a yaili with <i>one</i>
wheel!</p>

<p class='c012'>It is a delightful pastime to work out big schemes
for smashing up Europe, Asia, and America; in order
to rebuild the world tastefully and according to
hygiene, like a couple of happy children with their
bricks; but we have at last reached the conclusion
of the whole matter. East is East and West is West.
If they attempt to “take turns” building railways,
the trains will certainly “go off the line.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I have never been able to understand why anyone
should be so afraid of the Cheriat Laws. With all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>respect for my present company, I say, what I afterwards
repeated to Sir William Tyrell, “I would rather
trust myself in a Turkish court than appeal to
American justice.” In the first case, you may
find yourself in the hands of a kind-hearted judge;
the second adventure depends entirely on cash.
English justice has no equal; but our laws
for women are themselves unjust, and the best
workman can do little with poor material. Trials,
like marriages in foreign countries, should be illegal
unless the Consul, or someone equally expert, is
present to “watch for” his fellow-countryman. What
crimes have not we committed in the name of
Justice through ignorance of foreign customs!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Those who face the choice of trusting themselves
to the Cheriat or keeping away from Turkey, may find
that these laws are not so terrible after all,”
answered the American.</p>

<p class='c012'>Zeyneb once said that the great merit of Moslem
“Commandments” was the absence of mystery.
“The i’s are all carefully dotted. We are not told, for
instance, that we should give to the poor; we
<i>are</i> told the precise percentage of income that must
be allotted to charity. Though our laws come from
the great Prophet of Allah they are not ecclesiastical.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In Moslem countries the Head of the State must be
elected by the people; he has full executive and
legislative power, but he is also personally responsible
to the nation. We cannot deny that Mustapha Kemal
Pasha has rigidly adhered to this theory of government
in his daily practice.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is the true Democracy. Born without any
advantages of caste or family, Fethi Bey laughs at
all my allusions to “old ancestors.” The attitude does
seem peculiar to Western minds, and may often lead
to confusion between us, but it is not without charm.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How do these very intelligent, modern Turks
attempt to reconcile their zeal for liberal reform with
their firm loyalty to Islam? How do they account
for the decline in prestige and power that none
can deny has been their fate?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“My friends at the Assembly attribute the temporary
fall of Turkey to the strong, non-progressive,
influence of the hodjas, who have converted themselves
into a powerful priestly class, as forbidden
by the Prophet. Others attribute it to ignorance of
economics; others to Western remoulding of Islam,
and foreign oppression; others still, to a perpetual
state of war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is the Pasha’s personal opinion?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No man,” he says, “can live without complete
liberty and full freedom; nor can any nation. So long
as the interests of my own country permit it, I will
be the friend of all nations and all humanity; but
when any nation begins to tamper with our freedom and
our independence, as Germany did in the war, then
we can only resist and fight to the bitter end. I
sought to discover my people’s will, and I found they
were ready for any sacrifice to defend their country.
I had faith in the sons of Turkey, and my faith has
justified itself to the utmost.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There has, indeed, been no finer movement
among the ‘despised and rejected’ since the world
began.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>“Here comes my friend the sun,” I exclaimed;
“a snow-capped Olympus, the cypress beneath the
azure! Why is our driver using his whip with such
unusual success, just when we want to linger and
admire—— Do you know, my friend, should I paint
this soil, in all its varied tones from ruby to terra-cotta,
all men would cry out, ‘that woman always
sees her Turkey <i>en coleur de rose</i>!’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will bear witness,” laughed my friend.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, seriously,” I went on, “does it not mean
iron; rich veins of iron that it would <i>pay</i> someone
to produce?”</p>

<p class='c012'>In this district of lonely marshland, one can at
least rejoice in the cold for one reason. It has driven
away the flies and mosquitoes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why does not your country find the capital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>and send over our unemployed ex-service men to help
the Turks drain and cultivate these waste lands?”</p>

<p class='c012'>When I afterwards spoke of the possibility at
Lausanne, I was told that “something might be done!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Now we have reached Broussa, and our young
Turks hurry forward to announce our arrival to the
Governor.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is more trying than ever to lack springs, as
we jolt over the loose cobbles of these primitive and
neglected town streets. But I could cheerfully have
put up with far greater discomfort to reach, at last,
the “luxurious” (in comparison) Hotel Brotte, its
glowing fire, can after can of water, clean sheets, and
the blessed chance of changing one’s clothes and really
<i>brushing</i> one’s hair.</p>

    <div>A FEW DAYS IN BROUSSA—THE TRUE ISLAM ATMOSPHERE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>The</span> Governor who, once more, “comes from Malta,”
has detailed a police officer to look after me during
the five-days’ visit unexpectedly imposed upon us,
since there is no boat leaving before then. My journey
from Angora to Constantinople will, therefore, occupy
ten days instead of the regulation two or three.</p>
<p class='c012'>We start out the first thing in the morning and do
not return till dusk. I have never visited so many
mosques, and their colouring seems even more exquisite
than I have found it elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c012'>Naturally, however, we first went to pay our respects
to the Governor, who promised to give me certain
special information next day. His konak, however,
happened to catch fire soon after we left, and in
less than an hour it was reduced to cinders. There was,
fortunately, little wind, though, as we watched the
flames from our hotel, one could feel no security that
it might not spread all over the town and render us,
too, homeless.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was, as it happens, a brigand, descending by
chance from the mountains, who had saved the whole
town from destruction when the Greeks left it in flames,
after demolishing their church and setting fire to their
houses. Fifteen surrounding villages were, actually,
burnt to the ground. The French proprietress of
the hotel told me the town was not ravaged by
Ottoman Greeks, but by the Hellenes. Their own
Greeks cried bitterly at being compelled to leave,
but were terrified into flight, many of them dying at
Moudania or on the road.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>I heard an amusing story from my Dutch friend
in Smyrna which illustrates in what “great respect”
the Turkish army has always been held by Greeks.
One of their officers, reconnoitring on the hillside,
was seen to run back to his men, shouting: “They
are coming! They are coming! There are fezes
everywhere!” He had caught sight of a field of poppies!</p>

<p class='c012'>Madame herself is “desolated” by the departure of
her Greek servants, and puts no real reliance on the Jews
by whom she has been obliged to replace them. Although
getting on in years, she is eighty-six, she never dare go
to bed before any of her guests, lest someone should
ring and obtain no answer. I enjoyed examining, in
her visiting book, the signatures and humorous comments
of English prisoners, who were with her during
hostilities.</p>

<p class='c012'>Everywhere the Jews are stirring themselves, in
and out of their quarters, eager to take on anything
abandoned by the Greeks, as shoemakers,
plumbers, tradesmen, and labourers of all kinds. Nowhere
else, I imagine, could one hear them boasting
“I am an Israelite.” Our guests include many Jews,
and they are quickly finding their way more than ever
into the good graces of the Turks.</p>

<p class='c012'>I hope they will soon organise the splendid “bathing”
one could enjoy at Broussa if only some comfortable
rest-place were set up for recovery from the bracing
effects of such strong waters. Surely the Baths of
Broussa might be promoted into a gold mine!</p>

<p class='c012'>I wonder if the town is really as old as Angora?
In parts it is more dilapidated, as one can see from
walking about its deserted streets, so sorely in need of
repair, and glancing up at the broken windows on
every side. Nevertheless I, personally, delight in
the delicate charm of this famous Asiatic city, free
from a “Levantine” population and the relics of
Byzantium that rather spoil Constantinople.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The celebrated silk factories are not, of course, so
picturesque; and the depressing mixture of steam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>heat, and smell is certainly calculated to make one
long for the very latest kind of progressive machinery
to replace such unhealthy “human” labour. Here,
again, we find Jews and the so-called “Catholics,”
have replaced the Greeks; and the proprietors (who
are so often Jews) only complain that there are
not more hands available.</p>

<p class='c012'>This means, of course, not enough competition;
and wages have risen from thirty to sixty piastres a
day. For this reason they miss the Greeks and
Armenians, although the new men are equally good
workers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have also to employ Turkish women,” they
say.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are they good?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, very bad. They <i>can</i> work, but have never
done so, and have no experience. Yet we must pay
sixty piastres for their unskilled labour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then you are running the factories at a loss,
with these high wages?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no! We ‘make up’ for that by paying the
peasants half their old price for the raw silk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do they complain?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No. We tell them that times are bad; which
they understand, and accept.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It is an excellent example of the ease with which
almost anyone can make his profit out of the Turk.
He is satisfied with so little, and seldom, or never,
protests. For years Greeks and Armenians have filled
their pockets at his expense. Now we have driven
them out of their homes and Jews are quickly filling
their place. No wonder they turn on their Christian
“protectors,” and resent our “interference.” To
them money is the breath of life, and money is more
easily made in Turkey than anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>Whatever prosperity these districts have managed
to retain largely depends on the silk-making and the
tobacco factories. All the Europeans are, naturally,
against any attempts to abolish capitulations. “They
are not likely to leave us,” say the Turks, “where else
would they be granted ‘capitulations’?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>The bazaar at Broussa has lost none of its Eastern
charm, but prices have gone up by leaps and bounds
since I was here ten years ago. They will, probably,
soon rise still higher when hand-embroidery dies
out before the machine-made imitations.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Central Mosque has been rather disfigured by
the over-zealous multiplication of mural texts; but
the beautiful fountain preserves the most marked
characteristic of all mosques, on which their “appeal”
so largely depends. It also contains some very fine
specimens of the curious old clocks, which only show
Turkish hours.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the courtyard there are more fountains and
many pigeons, and the public letter-writer. Just
now he is hard at work for a profitable customer who,
one might think, surely knew how to conduct his own
correspondence. From my experience as an amateur,
doing my best for the <i>Poilus</i>, I should never imagine
that letter-writing could be an easy profession.</p>

<p class='c012'>How well I remember the poor boy (a particularly
serious “case”) who asked me to “tell Jeanne” that ...
“he was well and happy and enjoying himself.
But that some friends had written and told him she
had not been faithful, and ‘he didn’t care.’ All the
girls were running after him, and the grand ladies,
too. He hadn’t any time to think about <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He afterwards gave me careful instructions about
a P.S. “But I do think of her sometimes.” In
another few minutes it was, “I often think of her.”
And, finally, “you can tell her that I forgive her, and
love her as much as ever.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Every corner of Broussa reveals the true “Islam”
atmosphere; whether you look down on it from the
surrounding heights, or wander along its quaint streets
and alleys. Everywhere you see latticed windows,
mosques, and dervishes’ Tekké. It stands on a wide
stretch of marshland, seemingly going on for ever, with
its countless rows of skeleton-poplars, that stand out
in the blue-grey mist like ghostly sentinels.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>I decided there could be no better opportunity to
indulge in an adventure I had often contemplated:
climb up the highest of all the minarets to reach “the
top of the top!” The narrow and winding staircase
was sadly in need of repair; but at the long last I
found myself on the tiny balcony from which the
muezzin daily summons “the faithful” to prayer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you think I might sing?” I asked. “It
would be interesting to know how far the voice carries
at this height.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As you please,” he answered; but as it was clear
that he was decidedly embarrassed, if not shocked, I
contented myself with quietly humming <i>Gloria in
Excelsis</i>. When I told him the words—“On earth
peace, to men of goodwill,” he answered, reverently,
“<i>Inch Allah</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You see,” I explained, “the muezzin calls the
faithful to prayer, I call them to peace.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>As, perhaps, I ought to have foreseen, it proved a
far more difficult business to get <i>down</i> those steps than
it had been to climb <i>up</i>. Somehow the walls seemed
closing in upon me, and the mere idea of starting upon
the descent brought on a fit of unmanageable giddiness.
My guide promptly offered to carry me, but I did not
believe it could be done; and, in any case, I should
not wish him to make the attempt. When I have
plucked up courage to trust my own feet, they are
constantly slipping over the worn stones, and often
we find three or four missing altogether; still it would
not be possible to jump.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am only just in front of you,” said my guide,
“if you fall, you will fall on me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I <i>ought</i> to have been thoroughly ashamed of myself,
but I could only say, “You must let me manage my
own way and slide down as best I can.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I am perfectly comfortable in an aeroplane at an
altitude of 10,000 feet; and to this day I have never
been able to understand why that minaret made me
so giddy.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>We visited the tombs of Osman and many of the
other Sultans buried in Broussa, the ancient capital
of Turkey. The idea of the continual watching of
the tomb, and, indeed, the whole attitude of Islam
towards death, is full of beauty. One does not wish
to believe that the Greeks marched up to this Holy
Place with drawn swords, cursing the founder of the
Osman Dynasty.</p>

<p class='c012'>We also drove to the famous Green Mosque, immortalised
by Pierre Loti. The actual colour of this fine
building is a most wonderful turquoise blue; but,
like those jewels, it may, indeed, one day grow green
with age. Here Pierre Loti used to write his books, reclining
on the magnificent carpets, of which the
quality and beauty have defied time itself. On one
side stands the large door (replacing the altar) of exquisitely
blended green porcelain and delicate gold
lettering; on the other, the cool and sparkling fountain.
All day long he worked in this hallowed atmosphere;
where the invisible mouths of the fountain send out a
gorgeous mass of rainbow-hued spray into the sun’s
white rays.</p>

<p class='c012'>The guardian of the mosque, who used to serve
coffee and bring Loti’s narghili and arrange the
cushions, has been laid to rest near by; and now
Loti’s long life is drawing to its close. His best work
was done in the mosque at Broussa, as his countless
admirers should not forget—the shrine of one of
Turkey’s truest friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here, in the East, all may enter God’s House; and
it is here that every day, all day long, you see (as,
indeed, you may in France) men and women of every
sort and condition, unburdening their hearts of
joys or sorrows, some carrying a homely parcel, a
loaf of bread, or their goods to market; others carrying
their little children. No doubt, the mosque—or
the church—offers warmth and shelter; but its quiet
solemnity must turn our thoughts from all the pettiness
of existence, the false pride, and the ugly sin. Nor do
those who are, as it were, so thoroughly “at home” in
God’s House, pray with any less earnestness or sincerity.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>What a contrast to the cathedral at Geneva I
visited with a French ex-Ambassadress. We had to
send for the caretaker, who <i>unlocked</i> the door for us
and <i>locked it up again</i> as we left. Yet this was once a
church; holy men had dedicated their genius to make
it beautiful, because it was the House of God. It is
not God’s House now; only a building where men meet
and speak. “Have we, indeed, lost faith in anything,”
said my companion, as the door was closed behind us
“which of us would God Himself lock out? Are there
none left who would pray to Him? To what vain
and untrusting materialism will mankind yet lower
drift?”</p>

<p class='c012'>One morning, unable to hold in the interest awakened
by a handsome, young Turkish woman with veiled
hair, who was sitting near me in the hotel, I, at last,
ventured to ask her if she would “excuse my staring,”
but “she so much reminds me” of an old friend, Dr.
Nihat Réchad.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is my brother,” she replied in excellent
English, obviously delighted. It appears she had
lost touch with him for many years; only knowing
that he had been in prison and escaped to join Mustapha
Kemal. Now she hoped he must be coming into
his own again.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was glad to tell her how greatly we appreciated
Dr. Réchad in London.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our acquaintance brought me many new pleasures
in Broussa, in addition to her own delightful society
and her most friendly baby. She introduced me
to many of the nicest people in the hotel, and
arranged for us to visit the admirable hospitals of Dr.
Nazoum, head of the Army Medical Service, who was
a friend of her husband’s.</p>

<p class='c012'>There were two Turkish gentlemen, however (General
Kemallidine Pasha and Nourredine Pasha), whom
I had been warned <i>not to see</i>, because they were “such
bears and hated England”; naturally, having thus had
my combative curiosity excited, I eagerly sought for
introductions to them. And I could not admit the
justice of their condemnation.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>General Kemallidine Pasha is about thirty-five,
with an honest, open face and merry eyes, that strongly
reminded me of my brother; who—though not wounded
<i>eighteen times</i> like the Pasha—has been so frequently
sewn up as to present to the world, so I tell him, no
more than a figure of “threads and patches.” He
apologised for offering his left hand, obviously pleased
when I said, “it did not matter which of a hero’s
hands one is privileged to shake.” When I said that
I was sorry to hear he disliked my country, he gave
the only explanation I ever obtained from a Turk:
“It is because I once loved her so well!”</p>

<p class='c012'>And for that I have only one answer, provided for
me by Mr. D——, who was in Constantinople all
through the war, and is convinced that the English
were, throughout, entirely misled by Greek and Armenian
dragomen. He, himself, would never trust these
men to translate any newspaper article for him.
“Their work may be, and frequently is, quite correct,
but they are clever enough to impart an entirely different
<i>meaning</i> from one language to the other; for
example, with the word “iltehoc,” how can that word
be translated with all its shades of meaning?</p>

<p class='c012'>“The most dangerous Englishmen,” he said, “were
irresponsible young colonels of twenty-five, the familiar
“temporary gentlemen,” whose sudden access to
power and responsibility has, on other occasions, led
Great Britain into adventures she cannot, afterwards,
disown. One must regret, but can scarcely in
fairness condemn, some of these brave boys from
the “edge of beyond” in Canada or Australia, who,
of course, are absolutely ignorant of Moslem customs,
and, by training, rather aggressively impatient of the
slow ways of old England herself.</p>

<p class='c012'>There were Turks of a very inferior type to be
found to help them, as it would be dishonest to
deny. Those who made themselves <i>personna grata</i> to
the Allies, and enemies to the Nationalists, because
they would sink to any calumny or blackmail to
secure a “job,” or to keep one.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is, indeed, high testimony to the personality of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>General Harington that, despite all the crimes committed
“in his name,” General Kemallidine, Ismet
Pasha and Nourredine Pasha are unanimous in their
high tribute.</p>

<p class='c012'>Our empire is built on confidence in the “Man on
the Spot.” It has given us our unrivalled position
and a reputation for justice and generosity none can
rival. But, with the wrong men, it may have most
disastrous results; and, in Turkey, we still want to
know <i>who sent Turkey’s élite to Malta</i>?</p>

<p class='c012'>Kemallidine Pasha gallantly summed up his acceptance
of my explanations.... “Now I see the
difference between an English lady and an English
‘temporary gentleman’!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Dr. Nazoum has taken us to his office and showed
us his delightful sketches. He also removed some
ordinary picture postcards from their frame to show
us his wife’s picture hidden behind them.... “Twelve
years of a life that might have been given to one’s
family stolen from me for the rough and wandering
life of war. Only a photograph. That is my married
life.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>We also visited Nourredine Pasha’s father-in-law,
a dervish living in a Tekké, and revived all my enthusiasm
for their wonderful dancing to the weird
piping flute; although these dervishes are, I believe,
“contemplative.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I was invited, when at the Assembly, by the Grand
Tchelebi to visit Konia, the chief city of the dancing
dervishes, and was much tempted to accept. I have
never fully <i>understood</i> the “mystic dancing,” derived,
as I was told, from our Psalmist’s command to “praise
the Lord with dance and song”; but no one could
fail to recognise the fascination of the weird rhythm
to which the outspread skirts move with a haunting
grace that is all their own; like gigantic mauve and
brown poppies over the polished oak floor.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>We were unfortunately too late to see much of
Nourredine Pasha—the General was starting on his
Inspection. My guide had been too polite to tell
me my watch was slow. The General, however, found
time to entrust me with greetings to General
Harington, and to express more hopeful confidence in
the future relations of our two countries. I am certainly
glad I did not accept anyone else’s judgment of
this kind and distinguished man. He is, however, a
good ten years older than the other generals of the
Pasha’s new army whom I have met. I am now quite
accustomed to statesmen and generals of forty.</p>

<p class='c012'>I think I must really have seen <i>everything</i> in Broussa,
including the burnt hamlets of the countryside. I
remember a school-house in this district, where the
master had been paid in corn, and in which four generations
of women, who gave us sweet goat’s milk, were
now all living in one room, tastefully arranged with
cushions. They had been swept off the face of the
earth with the village in which they dwelt, by the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c012'>But I must not forget the hospital, full of poor
women—victims of the Greeks. If there <i>were</i> such
sights at the French Front, I mercifully escaped
seeing them; and here, for the first time, I realised
what some of my sisters have had to endure since the
spirit of war has come over us. Greek hatchets had been
at work on Mme. Roufy Bey’s patients; and, whether
in face or hip, back or leg, too many of these terrible
wounds were festering, because it had been impossible
to attend to them in time.</p>

<p class='c012'>I remember the mother who once answered her
little girl’s natural questions by telling her: “You
just grew on my heart.” “How lovely,” cried the
child, “is that why mothers all carry the babies so
near their hearts?” “Yes, it is where we keep them.”
Here was a poor Turkish mother whose little one had
been shot as it lay in her arms!</p>

<p class='c012'>Through this devastated area, and having seen the
utter destitution of these people, I should have
expected to find far greater bitterness towards the
Greeks. But they are well treated in all the prison-camps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>and never handled with brutality as they work
on the roads. Yet they look rough and desperate,
showing none of the resignation with which the Turk
faces captivity, however ragged and tattered. These
Greeks even seem afraid if a Christian woman
speaks to them, although they own that their alarm
does not come from either a guilty conscience or from
terror of their enemies, but only reveals the broken
spirit of men betrayed and alone. I feel, however,
that to be always surrounded by the useless and horrible
devastation you have yourself inflicted, must unnerve
the most callous of human beings.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>At about six o’clock on our last morning, an officer
arrives to conduct us to the station. The train starts
at 7-30, reaching Moudania at nine o’clock, where the
boat <i>may</i> leave at 9-30, or any time it likes. It is a
short and uneventful train journey, only relieved by a
brisk trade in tea at our two stopping-places.</p>

<p class='c012'>We find a high wind and rough seas at Moudania,
and the boat has not yet <i>arrived</i>! There is plenty of
time to drive to a unit of headquarters, where the
officer’s mother (whom he had “smuggled” through
from Constantinople) gives me coffee and cigarettes
beside a welcome fire. We pass the historic house
in which Peace was signed; one of the many
examples in Anatolia of great achievements from
small beginnings.</p>

<p class='c012'>Moudania is, on the whole, more depressing than
any of the miserable towns I have been over; and the
officer is, certainly, to be congratulated on having
secured the company of his mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was about half-past six in the evening when we
were summoned to embark; and there was no sign of the
“special cabin” that had been promised me in this
little cockle-shell of a boat, on which passengers, nevertheless,
are divided according to class. For my
part, I chose to travel second, as there was far
more air; and, as we opened the door, the “poultry
yard” gave us a hearty welcome! The women had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>taken their chickens and rabbits into their berths;
the floor was strewn with corn and lettuce-leaves! As
I disliked sharing my bed with poultry, I should be
happier in the cold outside.</p>

<p class='c012'>However, the first officer graciously gives up his
cabin. It is tiny, by no means immaculate, and papered
with cheerful postcards. But, in the place of honour,
Queen of Beauty among the ladies of the Levant,
hangs Gladys Cooper! I have never so much admired
that lovely actress as when now she seemed smiling
down at my mighty efforts to sleep in this tiniest of
bunks that had been built for someone of half my
length and width.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little tub ultimately started at midnight,
dancing over the waves to Constantinople, where
Turkish passports are no protection, and I must now
learn to depend on my credentials from England.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>What is going to happen to me? Very possibly
my passport will be taken from me, or endorsed with
the grim words “not to return to England.”</p>

<p class='c012'>My mission, indeed, was harmless, if not sanctioned.
I have, honestly, endeavoured to see that England may
be “a little better” understood by the Nationalists
in Anatolia. But in fighting Prussianism, we have
been slightly infected by that disease. It has
crept into our legislation and our administration. In
free England, Cæsar reigns. We can say, as the Turks
say, “We have <i>Prussia</i> to thank for our distress.”</p>

    <div>CONSTANTINOPLE NO LONGER THE CAPITAL—THE HEART AND SPIRIT OF TURKEY ARE IN ANGORA</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>As</span> our little cockle-shell reaches the busy quay at
Constantinople, the veiled women collect their animals
and carry them through the Custom house. I am the
only Britisher, yet the tall, well-built official rapidly
scans my passport and signs it without moving a
muscle, or showing the faintest surprise at my arrival
by <i>that boat</i>, not even opening his lips in reply to my
good-morning. Is this army etiquette? His kind
face has been taught not to unbend. It seems a foolish
way of encouraging foreigners to understand us.
“You are not English,” everyone declares, “dear
lady, you have too much heart to be English.”</p>
<p class='c012'>“We English have hearts,” is my reply, “but, for
some reason, we must pretend we have none.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Someone wearing a fez, perhaps a Moslem, insists
on taking me to the hotel, though I assure him that
I am quite capable of carrying my little bag, and a
few rugs over my arm. But he has seen Fethi
Bey’s letter, and nothing, clearly, will prevent him
from mounting beside the driver and burdening himself
with my belongings.</p>

<p class='c012'>At Tokatlians’ Hotel, however, the Armenian porter
handed him the truly magnificent tip of two Turkish
pounds. He assured me that others pay double that
sum for the little trip from the boat to the hotel!</p>

<p class='c012'>I see, at once, that there is a difference between
Angora and Constantinople. In Anatolia no one
would dream of thrusting his services upon his country’s
friend, or of accepting a two pound tip for so short a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>ride. My Angora host’s servants could not even be
induced to accept a tip when I left. At Angora there
was none of the Levantine haggling over the price
of a cab. In Constantinople I decided always to
leave such matters to the porter, who was a kindly
man and did his best. Nevertheless, I should seriously
advise the Nationalists, when they are back here, to
fix a tariff for luggage and cabs, as the traveller is now
intolerably imposed on.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is compensation, of course, in the return to
Western comforts, if not luxuries; above all, of the
hot bath. I have already taken three; and they tell
me that, if I still don’t feel clean, it is only because the
water is always brown. One can, further, obtain the
services of a manicurist, a hairdresser, and a chiropodist,
all worthy men; and how I enjoy these hot-house
sitting-rooms, and sheets like satin on the bed! A
touch of fever and full permission to stay tired, are
quite enough to make me perfectly content with my
one “weary” hat—until my luggage condescends to
get <i>un</i>-lost.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>General Harington invited me to the Harbié
(British Headquarters); chiefly, no doubt, to hear
about the big men I have seen in Angora. There
are few Englishmen more keenly interested than he
in the personalities of the Nationalist leaders, particularly,
of course, “the Pasha.” He speaks affectionately
of “that nice, honest, fine soldier,” Ismet
Pasha; and describes Refet Pasha as “a very clever
man, one from whom I have never had an unkind
or discourteous word. We are the best of friends.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I asked him whether “he was <i>altogether</i> in sympathy
with the Turks.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must remember,” he answered, “that I was
with General Wilson. No one could have had a finer
chief; and no man, I dare to say, could have followed
more closely in his chief’s footsteps than I.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Could not our troops be withdrawn, while such
an act might still seem <i>le beau geste</i>?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“We ought never to have been here,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It hurts my national pride to see you fine men
doing police work.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I told him all I had learned about “the Pasha’s”
opinion of the situation, and asked him when he
intended to retire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As soon as I feel really confident that Peace will
be ratified.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And Lausanne?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We shall have storms, but the result must be peace.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As soon as we dare hope....”</p>

<p class='c012'>I congratulated him on the rôle he had played at
Moudania.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am glad,” he said, “to have rendered service
to my country.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can you see any motive for this disastrous policy
in Constantinople?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can only suppose that, for some reason, Mr.
Lloyd George simply refused to listen to the advice of
everyone who knew Turkey, in favour of friends
entirely ignorant of the whole subject. I am almost
disposed to think he did not even consult his own
Foreign Minister.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why did you not go to Lausanne?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I was not invited. Lord Curzon and Ismet
Pasha appear to understand each other; and they
have clever experts at the Conference.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you not feel, however, that a “prejudiced”
expert may do even more harm than the Premier’s
‘men,’ who knew nothing?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you can prove they are prejudiced, yes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In my view, when the Turks mistrust them, it is
enough.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That, surely, is not for me to say.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I much fear it was “mistaken” modesty, which led
General Harington to think that his presence would
“make no difference” at Lausanne.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, his praise of Refet Pasha is well-deserved.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>It would, indeed, require an exceedingly
smart diplomatist to get over a man no one can
bluff, for all his courtesy and kindness. The
“wonderful little general” is always busy, but never
<i>too</i> busy to see the friends of his country, who all
delight in his wit.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is nothing he would not dare,” said Colonel
Mougin. “I can imagine him smoking a cigarette on
the edge of Vesuvius! With a mere handful of men
he held his own against regiments of Allies all along
the line.”</p>

<p class='c012'>When I first met Refet Pasha we spoke of Colonel
Mougin, with whom he had been photographed. I
told him that I had been fighting the colonel ever
since we met.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fighting with that charming man?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The charm of friendship is to fight in peace,” I
replied, “or <i>Discuter sans disputer</i>, as the French say.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He laughed heartily, and then spoke with the
deepest respect of General Harington.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have yourself given me an example,” said I.
“‘Love your enemies’, as it is written.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Colonel Mougin used to say that Refet Pasha had
the glorious spirit of a pioneer, and that his country
made good use of the quality. When he had cut his
way through the wilderness of Anatolia, they sent him
to take possession of Constantinople, though the
Allies were still there! At the same time, he was to
prepare the way for the axe that was once more
to chop with severity, speaking metaphorically, of
course, in the departure of the Sultan. When the
Government machine at Constantinople was running
smoothly, he was sent off to tackle Thrace!</p>

<p class='c012'>Refet Pasha spoke warmly of Colonel and Mrs.
Samson, not forgetting their charming little girl.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He rendered great service to Turkey during the
Siege of Adrianople. He likes the Turks.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Like all British <i>gentlemen</i>,” I interposed, to his
amusement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Enemies, or not enemies,” he said, “in spite of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>all the terrible things your compatriots have done, they
are fine and intelligent men. I ventured to say to them:
‘Perhaps, by bringing every man you can obtain from
the four corners of the earth, you may crush our forces,
but <i>never</i> our spirit. And remember, in crushing us
you will mutilate yourselves for ever!’ General
Harington knows that. He perfectly understands.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The General spoke of his twenty-eight years’ service:
the terrible hardship of these last years, when
they had to fight, not only the enemy without, but
those Turks who had thrown in their lot with the
Allies.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They say,” he went on, “soldiers love war. It
is not true. They hate it, because they know what
it means. Politicians want war and make war; we
only have to obey.”</p>

<p class='c012'>He has a very high opinion of the present Khalif,
whom I myself met ten years ago, in the days of
Mahmoud II.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everybody has the greatest respect for him,” he
went on, “and rightly; a fine gentleman and a great
artist.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How does he like not being a Sultan?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is the Khalif,” he replied. “In his place,
however, I might prefer the lesser honour and the
smaller responsibilities.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you approve of my going to Lausanne?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have worked hard, and honestly, at studying
the country and striven very sincerely to understand
my people. It will be well for your delegates to be told
the truth. Nevertheless, Lord Curzon himself knows the
subject inside out. He has made up his mind, and
knows exactly what he intends to do. Above all, he
thoroughly understands what effect his policy will
produce.”</p>

<p class='c012'>I believe every word. This time the Prime Minister
will have nothing to say; Lord Curzon has <i>full powers</i>.
His responsibilities are heavy indeed. With the terrible
heritage of “ugly debts” incurred in the name of
England, of which he will personally be held guilty for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>years to come! For him, the <i>right</i> way is not the
<i>easy</i> way.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>The British officials of Constantinople have been
most kind to me; as the only Englishwoman who
knows the story of Angora, and has been near to the
“heart” of the Turks; they hope I shall go to Lausanne.</p>

<p class='c012'>But who will listen? From the beginning of time,
has an Englishman ever asked a woman for her opinion,
or listened to her if she expressed one, even after being
consulted! Often, of course, a personality like Lady
Hamilton’s, may exert great influence; but men do
not come to us for information or advice on policy
however much we may know, however deeply and
clearly we may think. I am still uncertain of how much
our women may ever be allowed to effect in politics and
diplomacy.</p>

<p class='c012'>I once heard a story from a witty Frenchman,
which “hits off” our <i>men</i> to a miracle! Their stubborn
tenacity, which has never <i>conceded</i> an inch to
women that was not dragged out of them by main
force! A celebrated French Minister once came to
London in hopes of securing a certain concession.
When he had spent an hour explaining his case,
our great personages briefly replied: “You might as well
have asked us for a part of Hyde Park!” He tried
again, for another hour, with precisely the same result.
His reasons, any mutual advantages that might, or
might not, accrue, were absolutely ignored. They
only answered, “You might as well have asked us for
Hyde Park!”</p>

<p class='c012'>At Lausanne, unfortunately, there is every reason
to fear that the English and the Turks are <i>both</i> adopting
the method of not listening. It works, of course
(so far as getting your own way), if <i>one</i> party is firmly
in possession; but when the claim to control is
in dispute, and neither can be induced to yield, one
<i>must</i> feel that a little conciliation might be prudent.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Thinking it most unlikely that I shall have another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>opportunity of talking so freely to any British officials,
I have spoken with great frankness of what has been
in my heart for years, but what I now see can never
be changed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lord Curzon spoke courteously of my self-imposed
mission “to serve my country abroad,” but England
will never entrust such tasks to women, or even lend
them any <i>official</i> sanction.</p>

<p class='c012'>This, then, is my swan song of the work which I
have proved that a woman <i>can</i> do. Before leaving
the stage, I may say what I think.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you suppose that we are going to let any Tom,
Dick or Harry run our Embassies, as they do in
America, you are very much mistaken.” I was once
“officially” informed: “We may be accused of being
socially exclusive, but everyone knows to which Embassy
they should appeal when anything <i>has to be done</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That does not touch my complaint,” I answered.
“I shall continue to resent the fact that <i>we</i> are not
allowed the same footing as women in other countries.
We have at last secured the vote, and, theoretically,
the right of entry to all professions; but, proud as we
are of Lady Astor and Mrs. Wintringham, their
presence in Parliament has, rather unfortunately,
produced an impression of far more ‘freedom’ and
‘equality’ than we have actually achieved. Some
are indeed safely on the heights, but most women have
not yet even planted their feet on the lowest rung of
the ladder.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everyone knows that the Englishman is chivalrous
to women, and is their surest anchor in distress.
He will willingly die for them, but he maintains his
rooted objection to being asked to help them to live.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The French Government sent a <i>woman</i> to Angora
with the fullest official backing in finance and prestige.
Their Ambassador provided a plan for her journey, and
has made public acknowledgment of her service to
France.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We do not require women for this work,” was the
dogmatic reply; which also, of course, ignored the
<i>principle</i> involved in such official rigidity.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>But with the unfailing courtesy which the best
Englishman never denies to the women whose “interference”
he most resents, “I hope you made our
position clear to your friends the Turks. Those who
serve our Government have always done so of their
own free-will. <i>That is why we are served so well!</i>”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I approached this question from another angle at
Lausanne. As I have already pointed out, and illustrated
from experience in an earlier chapter, it is
most advisable, if not essential, that the Ambassador,
like other great “Personages,” should employ agents to
“try out” the petty “first steps” of any change in
policy.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was told by way of reply, that “the first qualification
for ‘entering diplomacy’ is to be twenty-one!”
This, of course, excludes a woman over thirty; a fact
that may serve for answer to many bitter attacks upon
my “Disadvantage of Being a Woman.” A man of
threescore is seldom considered too old for diplomacy;
a woman of thirty-five is fourteen years beyond the
limit.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What would you do with the old men?” I was
asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Teach them golf,” was my prompt retort.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>At the Front in a French uniform, speaking French
to my own compatriots, I was always unwilling to
confess my nationality. So long as they thought I was
French, they forgot the lady, and made a friend of the
woman! Shedding their “own” uniform, as it were,
they “let go” in homage and devotion; giving,
being, and appealing for <i>themselves</i>. But the moment
it came out that I was English, the open oyster
closed down and hid its pearl. From these spruce,
upright, and tightly-buttoned uniforms I could never
get through the politeness.</p>

<p class='c012'>As an interpreter in the Guards once explained it:
“When one of your Generals asks me to buy him a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span><i>Vie Parisienne</i>, he never forgets to add, ‘but don’t
give it to me in front of my officers.’” It must be the
same with women. The Englishman will allow a <i>French</i>
woman to “have a peep” at his soul. To his compatriot
he offers his dignity and his prestige—which are no
better than a bag of bones!</p>

<p class='c012'>What I have always known, has been brought home
more forcibly than ever during this trip. In matrimony,
at his office, and in the home, the Englishman
must be master. We can, if we must, accept a <i>good</i>
master. Who will help us against the <i>bad</i>? Do the
<i>Laws</i> of England?</p>

<p class='c012'>It sometimes seems indiscreet for an Englishwoman
to visit the British Embassies in foreign capitals, but I
rarely omit to call on the French; and there are, of
course, certain advantages, under some circumstances,
in a twin-nationality. I have been invited to their
Christmas lunch by General and Madame Pellé.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Neville Henderson, the British <i>chargé d’affaires</i>
at Constantinople, though certainly not pro-Turk, does
not hesitate to criticise the Greeks. An ideal sense of
balance for a diplomat.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Turks like Mr. Henderson; and when I remarked
on the apparent anomaly that “one can be
popular in Turkey without being pro-Turk,” I was met
by the astounding retort that “he succeeds because
he knows how to talk”—a strong argument against
“silent” diplomacy!</p>

<p class='c012'>I can only hope that he may long remain at his
post. Although he may not like to hear his beloved
Foreign Office called a “mausoleum,” or the burial-ground
for twentieth-century ideals. Of him, one can
repeat what a Cabinet Minister once said of France: that
“he is one of the few ready to give a criminal, or a
genius, <i>his chance</i>.” Though not an enthusiast for any
“Asiatic Revival,” he will accept the inevitable, and
cheer the winner. May he stay at his post <i>at least</i>
till danger is past.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I have just made my first, and I hope my last, stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>in Pera. The sister-in-law of my little Turkish
sister is dying, so I cannot accept her hospitality,
though she has begged me to come to her.</p>

<p class='c012'>What a terrible warning one can take from Pera!
I had not realised the danger of losing oneself in
the ambition to be truly cosmopolitan. These people
belong to all nations and have the souls of none. Their
faces have only one common feature—the lack of the
spirit behind all racial types, the entire absence of any
ideal. In Anatolia I found two forms of inborn
honour: the “nationalist” and the “primitive
peasant.” In Pera I stepped from Tokatlian’s Hotel
to the Embassy with the feeling that someone is
going to stab me in the back.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>This is the fourth Christmas I have spent in Turkey.
On the first occasion the Germans invited me to their
Christmas Tree; outside some Armenians sang
their exquisite native carols; which, like their folk-songs,
make one wish their characters were equally
fine. The concert, however, was interrupted by the
master-scavengers of Constantinople, the innumerable
dogs, against whose furious barking the Christians at
first bravely held on. But the “enemy” trotted away
to collect his forces from every quarter of the city and,
in the end, I won a wager for the dogs <i>versus</i> the Christians.
Our entertainers went home, amidst a never-to-be-forgotten
chorus of canine howling.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Constantinople the dogs certainly had their
own nationality. Divided against each other by street
feuds, the biggest troop coming from the “station
beat,” where cans of rubbish are emptied from the
Orient express, they yet <i>united</i> to drive out the
“alien” Christians from the fatherland of “Dogdom!”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so it is with the Moslems. If Albania and
Syria have left their fatherland, it is not wise for a
foreigner to utter a word against Turkey in their
presence.</p>

<p class='c012'>Mustapha Kemal Pasha will find no difficulty about
proving his confidence in Nationalism. “If Europe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>deny us justice, we shall obtain justice from Asia
The brotherhood of Islam stands solidly for us.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>This Christmas, after a pleasant dinner at the
hotel with Mr. D——, I asked him to take me to
church. “Can you hold on to Faith after what you
have seen?” he asks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have sometimes nearly lost hold. But when I
realise that ‘war’ has taken away everything else from
us, I just <i>hang on</i>, hard.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So I go to church alone, leaving the hideous
jazz-band and the noisy dancers; who drink and step
out like kangaroos by way of enjoyment!</p>

<p class='c012'>The eternal beauty of the midnight Mass carries
one right away from the dreadful tragedy of life,
handing us, too, spiritual food for the heart’s strengthening.
On the way home I was humming the Christmas
hymn, “Come and Adore Him,” when a clash of discord
struck at me from the approaching hotel-mob;
for <i>their</i> part, humming “<i>j’en ai marre</i>” (“I am fed up”)
the most contagious refrain ever uttered.</p>

<p class='c012'>I, very unreasonably, poured out my wrath on
Mr. D—— next morning. “Is it impossible to make
them realise what their song <i>means</i>? Nero fiddled
while Rome was burning; they are dancing to the
tune of a poor woman’s broken heart. Someone will
soon find a gay air for “the Song of the Shirt,” and
men will be hopping and braying to it.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>At last I am, fortunately, able to drive quietly
away from Pera. “You haven’t changed a bit, you
always disliked Pera,” my little Turkish sister had said.
“I remember that when we used to go to the Ottoman
Bank to fetch your letters you would have the horses
whipped up so as to ride to Pera and back as quickly
as possible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Again I am gazing upon the “Sublime Porte.” It
is still “sublime” and the sunset has not changed. Yet
no longer can it command my love; and woman does
not reason!</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>The old buildings are as magnificent as ever; the
sun is still sparkling on the gold; the picturesque
beggars are still there; the blue sky, the Bosphorus,
and the cypress trees!</p>

<p class='c012'>Only the heart and spirit of Turkey have gone to
Angora. This is no longer the Turkey of the Turks;
and so I am a stranger here, and there are no friendly
faces of the Anatolians to give me greeting.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Along the road the same houses are tumbling down,
at exactly the same stage of decrepitude. “Nothing
has changed, my child,” I say, “except my heart.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As we pass the old Tekké, however, I miss the
kindly face that used to smile on me from behind the
green grilled window; and we laugh over the curious
souvenirs I managed to obtain from that holy man.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was walking with Colonel Z., ten years ago, the
first day I noticed him at the window; the big,
lovely, dark eyes; the green swathed turban; the
Persian robe; and on his face the look of the “peace
that passeth understanding.” He must be the “Sower
that went forth to sow,” I said, “please take me in
to him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I cannot,” said the colonel; and so, before
he realised what I was doing, I just walked in myself
and told the holy man that “I had come to look at his
‘beautiful face.’” After that I paid him many visits,
sharing his coffee, making signs to the women, and
watching his strange worship, that had not even any
accompaniment of the piping flute.</p>

<p class='c012'>He told me that no Christian had ever before been
admitted into the Tekké.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you consider me a heathen?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, we are all children of God. How can one
of His children be a heathen?”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>“What has become of the old man?” I asked my
Turkish sister.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They ordered his son—you remember that fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>lad—to say <i>Vive la Grèce, Vive Venizelos</i>, and when he
refused, they shot him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But what of the old man?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It broke his heart. One day he just fell asleep
and did not wake again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The harem door is still open. The little daughter,
now thirteen, still calls me Tezajim (dear Aunt), and
we find seats on the marble veranda to wait for the
sun to set over the shores of the Marmora.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How often I think of you,” murmured my little
sister, “trying and trying, day after day, to paint our
sunset.” And when I repeated that to the late Sir
Alfred East he laughed heartily, saying, “Dear child,
Turner could not have done it?”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>And who has taken the place of my attendant, Miss
Chocolate? The slim figure of a coal-black negress
appears to answer my question, robed in brown velvet,
with a brown velvet toque. I must call her Miss Ink,
though her name is Mary.</p>

<p class='c012'>I lunch with my Turkish sister as often as the poor
sick woman can spare her, and she is generous. Yet
eighteen of her friends are there already. This time
my friend wears a fur coat and a black veil with
lace over it. “Fancy calling <i>that</i> a veil, I teased her.
Yet I can count the steps taken in the progress of
Turkish women by our lunches. The first time I came
to Turkey, you wanted to go up in a lift, and though
your father said neither ‘yea’ nor ‘nay,’ you did not go.
The second time you often used the lift. The third
time, we lunched at Tokatlian’s restaurant, ‘for ladies
only.’ Now you lunch unveiled (I don’t call <i>that</i> a
veil) in a <i>mixed</i> restaurant.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And yet, now you have won the privilege for
which you have been waiting so many years, you prefer
to lunch ‘with the ladies.’ How like a woman!”</p>

<div class='nf-center c010'>
    <div>LAUSANNE PALACE HOTEL—THE HOME OF TURKEY, FRANCE, AND JAPAN—“EVERY POSSIBLE PHASE OF COMPLETE INTERNATIONALISM”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>“Please</span> reserve comfortable room for Englishwoman
coming from Angora,” so ran the telegram despatched
by an American friend of mine, who had gallantly
determined that I should be well looked after. It was
both comfortable and warm; and, to complete the
welcome, my waking eyes next morning are caught by
the two flags I have learnt to love so well, the Turkish
and the French—the “standards” of two brave
peoples, with the fine spirit that nothing can subdue,
who would choose rather to be annihilated than to live
in servitude.</p>
<p class='c012'>Then I notice the flag of Japan! “What has
Japan to do with it?” I ask Ismet Pasha.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, Miss d’Angora,” he answers with a laugh,
“it is fine sport to watch the poor little bird as they
pluck out his feathers and clip his wings.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Indeed, Lausanne has been “revolutionised” by
this Conference of Peace! It is a golden harvest for
the hotels, which have not a room unoccupied. Every
day luncheons, dinners, and banquets! Everywhere
representatives of the world’s Press! I feel strange,
somehow, in a “neutral” country. Ever since 1914
I have been living, or travelling, over “seats of war,”
in lands fighting to defend, or attack, an Ideal.</p>

<p class='c012'>One can respect any sort of an “opinion” from some
point of view;  but “neutrality” and “anonymity”
do not sound to me like attributes in which a free
and independent people should feel much pride.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>Yet the “neutrality” of Switzerland means the <i>International
Red Cross</i> and the <i>League of Nations</i>; and
it has surely earned by its hospitality to the world’s
statesmen, a right to play <i>its</i> part in the historical
peace, for which “the God who Forgives” is waiting.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Orient express is bringing the peoples together;
Lord Curzon from London, Ismet Pasha from
Angora. May their political discussion travel under
one company to our home of peace! This Hotel of
the Strange Tongues is fast become a very Tower of
Babel, for it reveals every possible phase of complete
internationalism, from fox-trots and cocktails to the
folk-songs of Anatolia, sung by the Pasha’s Guards when
off duty. Here, too, are thronging a host of new
nationalities—Georgians, Bolsheviks, Syrians, Sons of
Palestine, and Armenians; each fired by their own
ideals, each proud of their independence; all sighing
for the (political) moon.</p>

<p class='c012'>For the moment, of course, the Conference has resolved
itself into a duel between Lord Curzon and
Ismet Pasha. Mme. B., indeed, is indignant because,
she says, “our English representative has so bullied
the French delegate that he has been obliged to take
to his bed,” though one can hardly believe that
proud and mighty Republic would choose a man whom
anyone could really bully to bed!</p>

<p class='c012'>I tried to imagine the Conferences of the future!
“We should appoint a bear for our delegate,” I said,
“send him round to all the other delegations in turn,
to grunt! When his confrères had all taken to their
beds, he could dictate his own term.... After the
senile sensitiveness of M. Barrère, the youthful
‘insolence’ of Riza Nour is most refreshing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>This is the first occasion of big diplomacy in which
Turkey has ever dared to assert herself. “A free and
independent Turkey” is so unheard of; one sadly fears
it may even now be dismissed as “mere bluff.” Do
they realise, or will they ever believe, that a vast, well-trained
army (who <i>may</i> be called fanatics) are <i>ready</i> and
<i>thoroughly prepared</i> (by military experts) to come out
at a word from their great leader, and once more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>save their Fatherland? It is sad to feel that the
“Hymn of Independence” I heard on all sides at
Angora, should sound as much “out of harmony” with
the tone of the Conference, as “Anatolian” folk-songs
with a Jazz Band!</p>

<p class='c012'>America has sent “representatives,” whose chief
is called <i>An Observer</i> and rejoices in the name of <i>Child</i>—“The
Child Observer” or, as it is whispered, “The
Boy Scout.” To point the humour of the situation, I
naturally expected to meet a hoary-headed old gentleman
with a long white beard, like his predecessor at
Rome, Ambassador Robert Underwood Johnson. But
though I was not aware of it at the time, he is the very
young man I reduced to silence, by inquiring the
way in what he called voluble French, who simply
led me to the place without comment, rang the bell,
and went away!</p>

<p class='c012'>At the Conference one still sees the Powers in turn
calling Turkey “to order,” when their own arrogance
has reduced her delegate to a condition of what the
Press calls his “more than usual insolence.” Then
the “Boy Scout” or “Child Observer” would “try
a little kindness,” to Ismet Pasha. “Don’t you see
the whole world is against you,” to which came the
dignified rejoinder, “We have become accustomed to
that.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As it was in Angora, everyone here talks politics all
day. But I am told that, while they only enjoyed themselves
at Genoa, they do work at Lausanne. I quite
believe in this “work”; certainly the Turkish delegates
are hard at it till two or three every morning. But they
do not forget enjoyment altogether. The younger
members from the commissions have treated themselves
to a <i>thê dansant</i>. “It warms your feet,” said
Hussein Djahid, who takes his dancing very
seriously. “Surely Turks don’t suffer from cold feet,”
I exclaimed, “and I don’t believe you really like it,
you only dance to show us that you can <i>dance</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Press is luxuriously installed in a miniature
palace of its own, at the Palace Hotel; a bar, of course,
a gramophone, a perfect dancing-floor, roulette, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>incidentally, “plenty of room to write.” Mr. Ward
Price politely regrets that “etiquette” will not permit
him to ask me for an interview. Why should newspaper
etiquette be allowed to hamper his “duty” as a
good sportsman?</p>

<p class='c012'>To the one journalist who really counts at
Lausanne (though his articles were not always printed),
I ventured to bring grave charges against the Press.
“How is it men of talent and education have allowed
themselves to sink to the level of mere machines, that
any ‘big’ proprietor can use to manipulate public
opinion? The ‘Power of the Press’ is a fraud.
You never give us the benefit of your knowledge and
judgment; whether we take a ‘pennyworth of news,’
or let ‘bang go saxpence.’ ‘Alas,’ said Shakespeare,
‘to choose love by another’s eyes!’ Is it not a hundred
times worse ‘to write by another’s ears?’”</p>

<p class='c012'>You write only what Mr. MacClure deigns to approve;
and, though doubtless honest and unbiassed, he is not
himself really “free.” He feeds you daily, like the
animals in Regent’s Park, and, after a good night,
you may digest the food. It would be far more honest
to issue an “official” Report, without the “false”
impression of personal judgments formed on the spot,
which a “special correspondent” is meant to produce.
The public is taught to laugh at Ismet’s pleasantries,
via Mr. MacClure! Now I have heard the Pasha rehearsing,
and Lord Curzon preparing his “part”;
but I still want to witness the duel upon the public
platform, <i>for myself</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>Could one ever forget the most dramatic moments
of the Second Conference at the Hague! Can such
incidents be reported unless one has actually seen
them! I remember Mr. Choate was down one
afternoon to speak on Disarmament. As he rose,
Baron Marshall von Bieberstein deliberately closed his
ears, and opened a sheet of paper and began to write.
Drawing himself up to his commanding height, with a
stern air of dignity, Mr. Joseph Choate began—“I
have prepared my speech with great care for the express
benefit of Baron Marshall. If the <i>noble</i> gentleman is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>too busy to “listen” this afternoon, he would, perhaps,
be good enough to make another appointment!”
Surely the fine picture of this grand American calling
the “noble” Baron to order upon a question of good
breeding is one which each correspondent must see,
hear, and describe for himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is, no doubt, largely due to the great difficulty
of obtaining first hand news, that most people are
anti-Turk. We were told, for example, that Riza Nour
was “insolent”; whereas he had patiently listened for
hours to nonsense about the “National Armenian
Home,” <i>before</i> he left the Conference room in despair of
being permitted to tell the truth.</p>

<p class='c012'>And, partly no doubt because they may not comment
upon anything of real importance, the papers are
always ready to enlarge upon some trivial detail that
is calculated to fan the flames of hate, or point the
finger of scorn, towards any Turk. Someone asserted
that the Turkish military expert had made a little mistake
in preparing a map. He himself did not admit
that he was wrong; but in any case, no one pretended
that the matter was in the least important; and it
could, ultimately, be rectified without the slightest
effect on policy. Remember, too, that the poor man
was working from surveys prepared on different systems,
and in a language that describes everything for
us backwards. It would not be remarkable if some
slight error <i>were</i> made in transposing the details to
European measures and methods. Yet the papers all
give columns exposing the “little mistake,” which,
most probably, was never made. Vital questions,
meanwhile, were almost entirely ignored in the Press;
and the “insolent” Asiatics are filled with bitter resentment.
It is idle for Mr. MacClure to say that
“they must expect criticism.” What they complain
of is not “criticism,” but the entire “ignoring” of
their point of view—a very different thing.</p>

<p class='c012'>The journalist whom I thus attacked admitted that
they deserved all I said. “The public,” he added, “<i>has</i>
been misled, one might say ‘cheated.’ I <i>could</i> myself
have supplied a good deal of first-class information,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>sufficiently dramatic and interesting to ‘raise
circulations’; had I refused my signature to the
‘official’ news so sparingly doled out for me to put into
shape. I can promise you that, on me at least, your
words have not been wasted.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Let us hope he may substantiate his pledge. At
present the Press is neither a critic, a check on intrigue,
nor an inspiration. It echoes the Governments, good
or bad. In Constantinople, for instance, the American
and English “special correspondents” frankly confessed
that they employ a few “scouts” to collect
copy, and merely “hash up” what comes in from
these “scavengers” of rumour and gossip.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Propaganda in the Turkish Press is under the direction
of Kemal Bey (the poet) and Ruchène Echref.
Men of such literary distinction, alas, are no better fitted
for such work than a watchmaker would be to heave
coal. In Turkey they do not understand how heavy
are the hands that can mange propaganda: that posts
are created for the men who can fill them, and men are
not made for any post that may happen to be vacant.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>It was always a pleasure, <i>and</i> a surprise, to meet
Lord Curzon socially at Lausanne; and if only his
traditional respect for British prestige would have
allowed him to be “himself” with Ismet Pasha and
the Turkish delegates, to approach discussions with all
the charm and wit that he knows so well how to exert,
I am convinced that the <i>practical</i> gain to both countries
would be enormous.</p>

<p class='c012'>For though in debate his “official” manner is
bound to emphasise the impression of a determined
man, so clearly knowing his own mind that argument
or even discussion is waste of time; I found him sincerely
interested in all the personal details of my trip;
and his penetrating questions were proof enough that
he is quite ready to hear all sides, and really anxious
to understand the country, the people, and their point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>of view, from anyone who knows them, irrespective of
what “heresies” they may uphold. To me personally,
he was not only courteous, but respectfully attentive;
the only Englishman whose compliments and
praise <i>meant</i> a real gratitude, a serious acknowledgment
of my fifteen years’ study and adventure, as “worthy
service to my country.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Ismet Pasha asked me if I had succeeded in making
Lord Curzon understand the grave importance of their
movement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I may have helped a little,” I answered, “I
believe I have. But he has always understood nearly
the whole truth. What I fear <i>you</i> and your friends
must find it almost impossible to understand is the
“public opinion” in the West, which he cannot ignore.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does he know how foolish it is to talk of a “home”
for Armenia?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He knows it would be as useless as to tie ‘a
swarm of bees under a donkey’s nose.’ But, though—as
you justly say—it is not their business, England
cannot ignore America and the Powers. It would not
bring you peace, or justice, to affront them. I do
not wonder that you and Riza Nour grow impatient
with the wasteful methods of traditional diplomacy;
but that is <i>our</i> way of democracy, to conciliate public
opinion by a pose of far greater obstinacy and intolerance
than we feel, or intend to act on.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>We in England, however, should realise that, however
wise and sincere Lord Curzon’s own sympathy
may be, the general attitude—in England and the
Continent—is still based on our interpretation of the
“old” Turkey. Our experts, for example, in Constantinople,
still approach the Nationalists as they
were accustomed to order about Abdul Hamid’s Turks.
They are, naturally and inevitably, “touchy” in
Angora, but we shall not help matters by any offensive
allusions to the “Moslem with his tail up, no
thank you!”</p>

<p class='c012'>It would be not only wiser and fairer, but more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>dignified, to congratulate these people on the achievements
of the Grand National Assembly, which the
“Mother of Parliaments” should surely welcome with
honour and respect.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>I found Ismet Pasha often depressed by the immensity
of his task; harassed, too, lest his own people
should not feel that he had done enough. “They
have sent me, a soldier, to fight a Bismarck, one of
your greatest statesmen,” he said one day.</p>

<p class='c012'>I repeated what Lord Curzon had told me, with
obvious sincerity, “You know, I <i>like</i> the little man.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I respect <i>him</i>,” was the prompt reply, as
his bright eyes lit up with renewed hope and courage.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another day he was again in despair. “Well, it
will just <i>have</i> to be war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But I would not hear the word. To all the Turks,
Riza Nour, Tewfik, Hikmet, I say the same. “We are
both in the wood. We must walk round and round,
until we have found a way out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It may sound paradoxical, but, while there is absolutely
no offence to British prestige in the National
Pact that is worth shedding one drop of human blood
to remove, it yet stands for such vital ideals, means
so much, and has been achieved with such grand courage
and self-sacrifice, that the Nationalists must uphold
and defend it to the bitter end. That is the “problem”
of Lausanne.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is, however, no reason why, if foreigners are
afraid to trust themselves, and the capital, in a Turkey
governed by Turks (without “protection,” which
means “interference”) they should not leave the
people to find their own way towards commercial and
political stability.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Lord Curzon, naturally, <i>told</i> me nothing; but his
questions enabled me to guess at what he wished
and intended to achieve. Perhaps I have guessed
wrongly.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Is he not anxious to keep Mosul, from fear of Russia.
We could buy the oil, and the Turks would gladly
sell it. Also a promise to Arabs has been broken
before now; and if our bungling has led Turkey into
a temporary alliance with Russia, no one knows what
will come of the German-Jew Soviets. Maybe, we
have far more need to protect India from them, than
to stand on our dignity with “new” Turkey.</p>

<p class='c012'>The British Empire was founded, and can only
survive, on Trust. It is a poor policy that dare not
act for fear of backing “the wrong horse.” It is a
criminal policy, when hesitation means war and the
loss of millions of lives.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lord Curzon’s association with the Coalition
has sadly shaken his high repute for “good faith”;
and unless he can see his way to come forward frankly
for a “free and independent” Turkey, the Nationalists
will fight in their own defence.</p>

<p class='c012'>There seem to me too many “Commissions” at
Lausanne. Closer contact between Lord Curzon
himself and those able men, Djavid and Hamid Bey,
as well as Ismet Pasha, would surely not only go far
to restore their confidence in his good faith, but
enormously “speed up” decisions on the <i>essential</i>
problems that need to be promptly settled.</p>

<p class='c012'>As I listened to the public speeches of Lord Curzon
I was haunted by all the fateful memories of the ruin
I had seen in Angora. The doubt <i>would</i> come; does
he really realise the supreme necessity to wipe out for
ever that awful page of history, to <i>establish</i> peace, and
to <i>help</i>, with all the tactful sympathy at his command,
the new nation to stand on its own feet. Maybe we
should even be comforted by hope, if our Government
would only take us more fully into its confidence. The
people of England are, after all, deeply concerned.
They have faith, they would gladly be loyal; but
why are they kept in the dark? When I am speaking
with the Turkish delegates, I sometimes fancy I
catch a look on their faces of “deep anguish” as we name
Lord Curzon, and my heart sinks. How am I to convince
them, certain as I am he is right, that he is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>drifting towards the false “sentiment” that has been
broadcasted to uphold the Greeks?</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>On the anniversary of the In-Eunus, I dined with
Ismet Pasha. When he refused dates I told him
that, “so long as he kept the ‘dates’ of his victories,
he needed no others.” “I left Constantinople with
nothing,” he answered. “I returned the head of the
Army.” Turkey gives every man his chance.</p>

<p class='c012'>So far as possible, I am dividing my time between
British and Turks; and no one can say that either
gives more time or “hard labour” to their responsibilities,
than the other. It is not possible, certainly,
for any visitor to interrupt Lord Curzon, he seems to
be working all the time.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>There is one figure we all watch carefully at the
Conference. I once compared the face of M. Venizelos
to an Apostle! Now he hovers round the British
Delegation like a bird of ill-omen, for some inexplicable
reason still mesmerising our diplomatists, carrying
trouble wherever he goes. Djavid Bey laughs to
remind me of how proud I had once been to pour out
tea for them both!</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>One naturally feels great interest in Melle Stanciof,
as the first woman diplomatist, and her personality
repays study. Tall and thin, with the large eyes of
the Oriental, she is very able, speaks English without
an accent, and loves her work. I repeated to her the
dogma that to be twenty-one is an essential qualification
for a diplomat; but she is twenty-seven, and only
laughed at the idea.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sir Wm. Tyrell, Permanent Head of the British
Foreign Office, with all his Irish charm and wit, is as
clever as Machievelli. He delights in calling himself
“Chief of the Underlings”; but men like Mr. Forbes
Adam and Mr. Harold Nicholson were experienced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>diplomats when their Turkish colleagues were in their
cradles; which, as Ismet Pasha sometimes complains,
“gives them no chance for a fair fight.” But when I
dined with them as his guests, there was no fighting;
and our host, I felt, was very well qualified to promote
friendly relations, by the cultured ease of his
hospitality.</p>

<p class='c012'>To my thinking, British “underlings” are very
able men, and not pro-Russian as the Turks are disposed
to fear. They were all anxious for peace,
and quite sincerely eager to understand the
nationalist point of view.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>During the conference both M. Poincaré and M.
Mussolini visited Lausanne and dined with Lord Curzon.</p>

<p class='c012'>I have had many talks about the Patriarch, whom
Mustapha Kemal declares must be removed: “He
must be got rid of, with the other relics of Byzantium!”
The problem is especially hard on Turkey,
because it arose from what ought to have been considered
the great strength of the nation, though—in
this case—it has been exaggerated into weakness,
her immense tolerance for other people’s religion.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the Byzantians conquered the Turkish tribes
who had emigrated into Asia Minor, they compelled
the tribesmen to be converted, and join the Orthodox
Church. The Bible, and all their prayers, were translated
into Turkish; whence, without design, the Turkish
Orthodox Church came into being. When, later, under
the Seldjoucides and Osmanli, Anatolia passed into
Moslem hands, no attempt was made to interfere with
the Orthodox religion of the people.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was only when the Ottomans ruled in Constantinople
and the Sultans used their growing power to
support the Greek Patriarch, that the Anatolians began
to see they were being manœuvred into the power of
the Helenes. During the war, the Patriarch’s intrigues
became more daring and more obvious; until Papas
Eftim Effendi proposed in the Assembly that Fanar
should be separated from the Orthodox Church, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>that the Orthodox Church of Anatolia should rule in
Thrace and Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yet when Ismet Pasha spoke of the religious “tolerance”
of Turkey, Lord Curzon replied: “How can
you claim to be tolerant. All your past record will
be destroyed if you dismiss the Patriarch.” And
rather than risk such a charge against the Nationalists,
he gave way.</p>

<p class='c012'>It seems to me, I confess, that this concession is a
grave risk. The interference, thus permitted, may
prove to be more disastrous than that of a few foreign
judges against which they so resolutely protest. As
Mr. Nicholson said he hoped that I had told Lord
Curzon how much the Turks were giving up.... “I
think,” he said, “their tolerance is very fine.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>Ismet Pasha often worked all night with his hench-men,
Colonel Tewfik and Hikmet Kiamil, a grandson
of Kiamil Pasha, who has inherited his grandfather’s
political talents. They felt that the slightest failure
to meet the immense demands made on the delegation
would stamp them as an inferior race, and they determined
it should not be.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was actually after one of their most arduous
sittings, up to three o’clock in the morning, that I
obtained from Ismet Pasha the comprehensive exposition
of his point of view, that I have put together
in the following pages.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ismet Pasha, like Mr. Edison, is deaf; and possibly
feels with that great inventor that, “though it is
uncomfortable when people insist on making a spitoon
of your ear, for the rest <i>it is all advantage</i>.” For example,
at dinner one can “get on with one’s thinking,”
instead of listening to the conversation. Ismet Pasha
only “hears what he wants to hear,” often a great
advantage in diplomacy.</p>

<p class='c012'>As to being content with the “working of the Conference,”
he said, “we are doing all in our power to
make peace, but it is difficult for one nation against
all the other powers. Willingly or unwillingly, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>cannot see what our National Pact means to us; and
that, as a proud people, we cannot accept terms of
peace which they would not think of offering the
Greeks and Bulgars. It is said that the Great Powers
must conciliate public opinion which hates and distrusts
us as ‘barbarians,’ but we feel certain that the
Powers could deal with ‘public opinion’ if they so
desired, and convince the whole world that we are now
working by civilised methods to become a free and
independent nation. Instead of facing the vital question
of a ‘right to exist’ as a State, we feel that much
time has been wasted over details that do not need any
discussion. It is known, for example, that we are
offering, what we have always offered, <i>equal</i> rights to
Moslems and Christians; yet we are asked to establish
<i>in</i>equality by exempting Christians from military
service.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If ever the Powers consent to accept our point of
view, it is considered a great concession, and when we
point out that our <i>whole</i> demands have been reduced
by us to the lowest minimum, they laugh; imagining
it is a ‘concession’ to give us back <i>one room</i> in our own
house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For three years, Turkey has given proof that none
can dispute of her organising capacity, her great
vitality, and her deep longing to regenerate her
country. We came here hoping and believing that
the plenipotentiaries would bear this in mind. They
do not. They beg us to ‘trust’ them; but they
treat us with the same caution, the same <i>dis</i>trust, as
they have always shown towards the old ‘decayed’
Turkey, towards which, maybe, there <i>used to be</i> some
slight justification. Such an attitude cannot produce
satisfactory progress.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What are the chief obstacles to Peace?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mosul—Finance—Judicial Capitulations—Reparations.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are only asking four milliard gold francs for
reparations. That is a small figure for a country that
has been completely devastated, and it takes no count
of loss of life.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“Mosul was never captured by Great Britain,
though they claim the right of conquest. Their
troops were a long way from Mosul when ours were
demobilised at the end of the war. They ‘captured’
it by ‘violating the terms of the Armistice’; as they
did at Constantinople, and as the French did in Cilicia.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The population of Mosul is Kurd and Turkish,
with only a small Arab minority. It must, therefore,
belong to Turkey on all the principles by which the
Powers have determined the frontiers of Europe.
This was recognised, indeed, in the Sykes-Picot agreement,
which admitted that Mosul is <i>not</i> a part of
Mesopotamia.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was finally handed to England by the French
Foreign Office; but M. Clemenceau afterwards
apologised that he had not previously ‘<i>known of the
oil there</i>.’ The Kurds of Mosul have nothing in
common with the Arabs; and naturally want to be
united with their ‘brothers’ in Anatolia. Why are we
the only nation to whom the principle of racial
frontiers has been denied? By what kind of justice
does an Arab minority, probably smaller than one
quarter of the population, give England the right to
annex Mosul!</p>

<p class='c012'>“To insist upon our accepting ‘foreign judges,’ is
an humiliating insult to our Government that is altogether
incompatible with National Sovereignty. Such
interference, and such an affront to the authority of
the State would be no less injurious to the interests of
foreigners in Turkey than to our own. It could not
fail to provoke continual clashing of interests, confusion,
and friction between Turkish and foreign administration
of law, that would be fatal to commercial
security <i>for all alike</i>. Here again the Powers are still
‘building on sand.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“As to finance, it is a serious difficulty for us;
but no question of mere money will ever separate us
from England.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I firmly believe that, when once the Powers can
get rid of their old prejudices, the traditional friendship
will revive. England and Turkey, surely, need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>each other; we need England and England needs us,
if only to pacify those Moslem people whom <i>England’s
injustice to us</i> has roused to righteous anger against her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A strong Anglo-Turkish alliance would mean not
only peace in the Near East and for Islam; it means
peace for the whole world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>People have asked me “Why did Lausanne fail?”</p>

<p class='c012'>I answer: “It did <i>not</i> fail. It <i>would</i> have been
failure had Ismet Pasha signed, at the pistol’s point,
a treaty that could not be ratified. He knew that
the Assembly would never sign the terms offered by
the Powers; and, as I told Lord Curzon, he had to
consult his colleagues in Angora. It would hinder
peace, not promote it, to sign with no security for
ratification.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As Ismet said, “We have purchased our Anatolia
with the blood and money of her peasants. We can
die, but we cannot betray them.”</p>

    <div>TURKEY AND THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS—THE PARLIAMENT OF NATIONS MUST BE TRULY IMPARTIAL AND INTERNATIONAL</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>For</span> those of us who pinned their faith on the League
of Nations, it is a matter of the deepest regret that
Turkey has lost her trust in the great Parliament of
All Nations, especially now that it could have played
so important a part in settling our differences at the
Lausanne Conference. It is not entirely the Turks’
fault; indeed, considering all things, one can scarcely
urge them to any other attitude.</p>
<p class='c012'>To them, at least, the League must seem definitely
anti-Islam, and (as founder of the Lyceum Club
‘League of Nations Circle,’ of which Lady Gladstone
is president) I have continually endeavoured to impress
upon Lord Robert Cecil the danger of allowing such an
idea to remain uncontradicted, that it may spread
more widely and be more firmly held.</p>

<p class='c012'>Turkey never interfered with British property
during the war, and British merchants continued their
business in Smyrna throughout the hostilities. Yet
we not only confiscated, but sold enemy property.
In one case, for example, the business of a man, brought
up in England and a pronounced Anglophil, was sold
to a Greek for a quarter of its value, and the money
sequestered by the Government. Had the Bey even
been a traitor he should have been given the full value
of his business, and then expelled, instead of being
driven to exist on money borrowed at an exorbitant
rate of interest. On the other hand, Ottoman “Christian”
property was freed from sequestration; a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>distinction between “neighbours,” hardly consistent
with the teaching of our faith.</p>

<p class='c012'>The “pick-pocketing” habit of confiscating enemy
property—Turkish, German, or Austrian—is surely
beneath an Empire with our reputation; and the
plea from France and Italy’s example does not strike
one as a dignified defence. As a matter of fact, France
emphatically denies ever having taken a penny from
the Turks.</p>

<p class='c012'>Is not such flagrant injustice an obvious case for
the League’s authority to intervene? When visiting
the “League of Nations” headquarters in Geneva the
other day, Sir Eric Drummond asked me why Turkey
should be so suspicious of the League? I could only
refer him to the public speeches of our most responsible
statesmen. When Mr. Lloyd George hurled insults
at Islam, it only meant one more item in the big bill
of Moslem grievances against England; when Lord
Balfour and Lord Robert Cecil speak in similar strains,
Islam listens. While <i>they</i> refuse justice and mercy,
Turkey mistrusts the League.</p>

<p class='c012'>Because the League stood aside, and left the Greeks
in Smyrna, as Britain refused discussion with Turkish
emissaries, Mustapha Kemal was driven to arms, which
gave Turkey, indeed, the victory, but spread ruin
throughout Anatolia.</p>

<p class='c012'>Should not a careful consideration for the <i>feelings</i> of
all nations be an outstanding characteristic of the
League, which is the expression of the world-brotherhood?
Yet it suggested that a man, a Mr. Pitt,
should be allowed to search the harems for enslaved
Greeks and Armenians! An incomprehensible insult
that, if Turkey ever forgives, she cannot forget. The
Turks are a proud and aristocratic race, with venerable
traditions, which, if we will not understand, we should,
at least, respect. To them, home-life is a sealed and
sacred book.</p>

<p class='c012'>Why, again, was the preparation of a full report on
“harems” entrusted to a Roumanian poetess, rather
than to such a woman as Halidé Hanoum, of tried
experience and world-wide reputation for liberal broadmindedness?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>We have depended, in the past, chiefly
on nursery governesses whose exaggerations and misconceptions
on this subject are invaluable to sensational
writers. Hence the sordid colouring for Western
eyes thrown on a system of delicate lights and shades
and very complicated nuances.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Greek and Armenian servants in Turkish
harems would be themselves the first to resent interference.
For they are treated in Moslem homes with
an equality, consideration, and leniency no Christian
mistress would dream of permitting. They, often,
practically control the household, and are, indeed,
sometimes given an unwise preference in the Pasha’s
affections. They hold the purse-strings, direct, advise,
and administer domestic affairs, as they also, so largely,
manage the commercial life of the country. In return,
naturally, the Turk expects absolute loyalty; and woe
to those who refuse, or betray, it.</p>

<p class='c012'>It is true, of course, that backstairs propaganda—from
American Relief Workers, among others—has
been at work to misinform the League; and had reliable
information been available, those unfortunate
mistakes would never have been made.</p>

<p class='c012'>Indeed, the honestly impartial head of its own
Press department now reports: “We have tested the
real value of Greek and Armenian propaganda, and
sympathise with the Turk in consequence.” Such
repentance comes rather late in the day, but may even
yet produce a wiser policy.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was one of the Fethi Bey’s many humiliating
experiences, on his visit to London, to see the harem
misjudged by an ex-governess, and to read the assertion
of a lady from Boston that “beautiful Greek girls
had to disfigure themselves to prevent the Turks from
stealing them!” Statements that might have been
treated with the contempt they deserve, had they not
been accorded such prominence by the Press.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, one must acknowledge that the
Turk’s attitude towards his detractors is more lofty
than practical. Pride forbids him to answer accusations,
or disseminate the truth; which he, as a fatalist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>firmly believes “must out”! They will, certainly,
never hoist the propagandist “on his own petard,”
since, to their thinking, the man who accepts money
to defend a cause is no better than a “political
prostitute.” They argue that “he who works for
me, must believe in me, as a true friend, eager to
help.” And for the moment, Europe has made them
feel that “facts” would avail them nothing—“whatever
we do is wrong.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In the East news spreads with accurate rapidity
without the assistance of newspapers; but the foreigner
who needs chapter and verse for every statement may
be, to some extent, excused for suspecting their obstinate
reticence about statistics and exact figures. I should,
myself, have welcomed more information about a
story I quite believe, but cannot substantiate, that
came from an Italian lady at Broussa. She said that
the Greeks burnt a Turkish prison, <i>with all the prisoners
in it</i>, and, “to her dying day she would never forget
their awful screams,” but no one will give me the least
idea of how many prisoners were slaughtered. I called
on a Vali whose palace was burned to cinders before
I had the information. And I could discover no precise
details, despite inquiry at Angora, Constantinople, and
Lausanne!</p>

<p class='c012'>The Norwegian head of the Minorities Committee,
a man given to wise and just decisions, has said:
“It is no use expecting Asiatics to be Europeans.
They have as much right to do things in their Asiatic
way, as we have to act like Europeans. There are
standards of right and wrong, against which neither
may transgress, but for the rest, nothing can be done.”
He also agreed that to secure protection from a minority,
you must enforce loyalty to the majority. I told him
the head of the Armenian community had begged the
Pope to see that they “were left to the mercy” of the
Turks, which <i>is</i> merciful.</p>

<p class='c012'>The League can really help Christians in Turkey by
putting a stop to pro-Christian propaganda, for which
Armenians in Anatolia will have to suffer.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is so much that the League of one’s dream
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>could do for Turkey, as for all the peoples; and we
criticise only from hope and desire of some hastening
in its approach to perfection, and the establishing
of its supreme authority. As Sir Eric Drummond
pointed out, the high-handed and retrograde attitude
towards Eastern problems would not be possible were
Turkey represented on the council: as others have
seen, that while the so-called “enemy” peoples are
unrepresented, the League cannot be truly either impartial
or international.</p>

<p class='c012'>To secure equal justice for all, it must stand outside,
and above, divisions of race, creed or prejudice.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless, we hope that Turkey will trust the
“imperfect” League. Maybe, after all, in dealing
with Mosul, it would grant the plebiscite which Lord
Curzon declares is “impossible.”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>It is not generally known why Colonel House chose
Geneva, in preference to Lausanne, as the seat of the
League of Nations.... After long and careful deliberation,
which yet produced only indecision, I am told
that he asked his valet’s advice.</p>

<p class='c012'>Joseph replied: “Geneva would be much better
for your rheumatism!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Once installed, however, Colonel House discovered
another reason. At Geneva, lived Josephine!</p>

    <div>THE FUTURE—ABOVE ALL, A LASTING PEACE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Will</span> the future bring us peace; above all, a lasting
peace? Though nothing less is worth having, <i>we
cannot have war</i>.</p>
<p class='c012'>I saw M. Franklin-Bouillon in Paris and, though
not perhaps in agreement with all he did in Syria, I
maintain that his work in Moudania deserved
thanks rather than criticism. He knows the Turks
well, and affirms that he would have made peace at
Lausanne. He possibly might have done so, but
would it have been <i>lasting</i> peace?</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>On my way back to London we cross the channel
in a Handley-Page Aeroplane. There is just time to
prepare a conclusive answer to all questions about the
harem; for no matter how eager we are to proceed,
after six months’ study of the Angora movement,
to more important impressions, every newspaper
correspondent asks about the harem.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just as for those who, in the States; held me
personally responsible for our policy in Ireland, I
stole from <i>Life</i> a witty answer, compressed into this
dramatic “tabloid,” that “turned away American
wrath”:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Pat</i>: Wouldn’t it be awful if England now gave
us all we wanted?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Mike</i>: Sure, and ’twould be like her to play us the
dirty trick.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In like manner, I prepared two shots to kill “harem”
inquiries:—</p>

<p class='c012'><i>One</i>: “Why has the Turk only one wife, to-day?</p>

<p class='c012'>“When four wives meant four tillers of the ground,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>there was ‘sense’ in polygamy. It is ‘folly’ now
they buy their dresses in Paris.”</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Two</i>: “Why are you always so early at the
Mosque?” a pious man was asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As I have two wives, I leave home as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The result was as I expected.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c012'>But what about the peace for which we all wait so
anxiously?</p>

<p class='c012'>What has the future in store for us? We must
turn over a new page, and find our way with great
care, both sides first uttering their <i>mea culpas</i>, with
honest courage to learn the lesson of their mistakes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Above all, may Lausanne learn the lesson of Versailles.</p>

<p class='c012'>Which of the Big Four dared face <i>the real problems</i>
of Versailles? They decided nothing, but, leading
us into the pestilent zone of neutrality, imposed a
“Government by Committees” upon the world, which
could not work. Nature abhors neutrality, as she
abhors a vacuum. And so it is in politics.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the other hand, however, we ask ourselves what
nation was as badly beaten as Turkey? Yet which
of our late enemies has dared such open defiance to
the Allies? Not, however, in consequence of their
victory over the Greeks; but because she knows that,
however much we may pretend, none wants to fight;
and no one can win the prize of “Constantinople”
save by conquest.</p>

<p class='c012'>We had foolish visions of a new Byzantium, and
thought that Greece would reward our support by a
“place on the Bosphorus.” But had the Powers
accepted this monstrous idea of a Greek Bosphorus,
we should have found it necessary to punish the arrogance
of our <i>soi-disant</i> fellow-burglars. The <i>timeo
Danaos</i>, etc., of ancient Greece has still its place in
modern politics.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Allies, however, knew they could not create a
“neutral” Constantinople, and had intended, before
the Bolshevik regime, to present the prize to Russia.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>A “committee” government of France, Italy and
England would mean English rule; and our blundering
had been too patent.</p>

<p class='c012'>There remained no choice. Constantinople had to
be given back to Turkey. Though she was beaten in
the Great War, which she has now forgotten, we could
not conquer her (single-handed, as we should find ourselves
to-day); and, therefore, “she has to have her
own way.” The endeavour to curb New Turkey by
“neutral zones” would prove as useless as an attempt
to check the tides. It is only by an honest peace, carefully
thought out in every detail and planned for permanent
security, that we can regain our prestige in
the Near East.</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps, however, the greatest lesson we have still
to learn from Turkey’s victory was spoken in Gœthe’s
lines:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“He who would be just must have consideration
for <i>all</i> men.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Or again, as it is written in the Turkish lines quoted
by Professor Browne:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Kam máta gawm un wa ma mátat makárimee pum</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Wa asha gawm un was hum fi ’n—nase amwátu!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Many a people’s virtues survive when themselves are sped,</div>
      <div class='line'>And many a people linger, who are counted by man as dead!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Turkey is not dead, but born again out of the
ruins of a Great Civilisation. May there be peace again
between East and West, that shall bring peace to a
world so greatly needing what it so little deserves!</p>

<p class='c012'>My final words are of sincere congratulations to New
Turkey, of warmest thanks to all the friends who gave
unending interest to my visit, of pious hopes for peace.</p>

<p class='c012'>At Lausanne, Ismet Pasha always gave the toast
of “The British Empire and King George,” and I responded
with “Turkey and Mustapha Kemal Pasha”;
then we touched glasses, coupling the names. May
“coming events cast their shadows before.” <i>Inch
Allah!</i> and again, <i>Inch Allah!</i></p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
